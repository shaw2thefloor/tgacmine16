The strongest predictors of a current year's risk were the prior year's abundance of mice and chipmunks and abundance of acorns 2 y previously. In no case did inclusion of deer or climate variables improve the predictive power of models based on rodents, acorns, or both. We conclude that interannual variation in entomological risk of exposure to Lyme disease is correlated positively with prior abundance of key hosts for the immature stages of the tick vector and with critical food resources for those hosts.

Examples include West Nile virus, ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis, tick-borne encephalitis and Lyme disease. In each case, the vector&#x02014;usually a mosquito or tick&#x02014;acquires the pathogen from a vertebrate host during a blood meal taken early in the life cycle and becomes capable of transmitting it to humans during a later blood meal. Risk of human exposure to the disease increases with increasing abundance and infection prevalence of the vectors &#x0005b;

				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040145-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. Lyme disease is most prevalent in northeastern and north-central regions where suburban and exurban development encroaches on deciduous forest ecosystems that support the pathogen, vector, and their vertebrate hosts &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040145-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. The etiological agent is a spirochete bacterium, 
				<italic>Borrelia burgdorferi,</italic> which is transmitted by ticks in the 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species">Ixodes ricinus</named-content> complex. In the eastern and central US, the vector is the blacklegged tick, 
				<italic>Ixodes scapularis. I. scapularis</italic> is a three-host tick, requiring three blood meals, one each as a larva, nymph, and adult, to fulfill its life cycle. Larval ticks hatch in midsummer, typically uninfected with 
				<italic>B. burgdorferi,</italic> and begin seeking a host for their initial blood meal. After feeding on a vertebrate host for several days, the larvae drop off the host and molt into the nymphal stage, which undergoes diapause for almost a year before becoming active and seeking a host the following late spring or early summer. Both larvae and nymphs are highly nonspecific in their choice of hosts, parasitizing dozens of species of mammal, bird, and lizard &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040145-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. After feeding to repletion, nymphs drop off the host and molt into the adult stage, which seeks a medium- or large-mammal host in midautumn of the same year. Infection with 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species">B. burgdorferi</named-content> can be acquired from the host during either the larval or nymphal blood meal, and both nymphs and adults are capable of transmitting infection to a vertebrate host, including humans.
			</p><p>Owing to its tiny size, potentially high abundance, and summer feeding, the nymphal stage is most likely to transmit 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species">B. burgdorferi</named-content> to people and hence is responsible for the great majority of Lyme-disease cases &#x0005b;

				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040145-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;), is a function of the density of infected nymphal ticks, which in turn is the product of the total density of nymphs (DON) and the nymphal infection prevalence (NIP) &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040145-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Determining the causes of variation in density of infected nymphs (DIN) and its component parts is an important goal with both ecological and epidemiological implications. Human behavioral patterns, such as time spent in forest habitat and protective measures taken against exposure to ticks, also influence Lyme-disease risk but are beyond the scope of this study.
			</p><p>Prior studies of the factors influencing DIN and DON have focused largely on variation in climate and in the abundance and distribution of white-tailed deer 
				<italic>(Odocoileus virginianus).</italic> Because ticks spend greater than 95&#x00025; of their lives on the forest floor either digesting the blood meal, undergoing diapause, or seeking a host, exposure to ambient temperature and humidity could be important to survival rates and population dynamics &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040145-b012">12</xref>&#x02013;

				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040145-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Consequently, hot and/or dry springs and summers have been postulated to reduce subsequent nymphal tick densities and Lyme-disease risk &#x0005b;

			</p><p>Less attention has been paid to the potential effects of variation in abundance of hosts for larval ticks in influencing variation in DIN, DON, and NIP. This is perhaps a consequence of the lack of specialization by larvae on any particular host species. However, larval 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species">I. scapularis</named-content> feed abundantly on white-footed mice 
				<italic>(Peromyscus leucopus),</italic> and this host is the most competent natural reservoir for

				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040145-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;, the impacts of variation in chipmunk abundance on Lyme-disease risk have been even less thoroughly explored (but see &#x0005b;

			</p><p>The food resources for tick hosts might also be important to Lyme-disease risk. Oak trees (
				<named-content content-type="genus-species">Quercus</named-content> spp.) that dominate many forests in the US Lyme-endemic zone are known to produce highly variable acorn crops, a phenomenon known as masting. Acorns comprise a crucial resource for several vertebrate species, including white-footed mice, eastern chipmunks, and white-tailed deer, and can influence population density of the rodents &#x0005b;

				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040145-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d; described a positive correlation between metrics of Lyme-disease risk and both prior-year mouse abundance and acorn abundance 2 y previously.
			</p><p>No prior study has assessed simultaneously the effects of variation in temperature, precipitation, deer, mice, chipmunks, and acorns, on variation in entomological risk of exposure to Lyme disease (
				<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040145-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Assessments of subsets of these putative causal variables are characterized by relatively short time series, which have limited power to assess the influence of each factor separate from the others. Here we use long-term monitoring of these parameters combined with model comparison approaches to address the causes of variable risk in an area of high Lyme-disease incidence.

Both DON and DIN were influenced, again weakly, by precipitation in the current but not prior year, but intermediate levels of precipitation favored highest nymphal abundances. Again, this result conflicts with the expectation that tick survival increases linearly with ambient moisture &#x0005b;
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040145-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. Low DON and DIN in years of high precipitation could be caused by either flood-induced mortality or that caused by natural enemies (e.g., fungi) that are facilitated by high moisture &#x0005b;

NIP is determined by the proportions of larval tick meals taken from the various host species, which vary strongly in their reservoir competence. It seems unlikely that climate variables will influence the choice of hosts by larval ticks or relative abundances of different hosts. It remains possible that climate variables other than the ones we examined influence stage-specific tick survival and abundance and that the weak or absent effects we observed are a result of not including more important variables. Our analytical approach could easily support assessments of other variables for which there is some a priori expectation of an effect.

This observation supports the assertion that, once deer abundance exceeds a low threshold value, further increases in deer density have little if any effect on nymphal densities &#x0005b;
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040145-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;. We did observe a weak effect of deer on subsequent larval abundance, but larval abundance in any given year had no impact on next year's abundance of nymphs. This clear but surprising result indicates a decoupling of stage-specific abundances and suggests instead that abundance of nymphs depends on larval feeding opportunities the prior year (see below). The lack of demographic forcing from larval to nymphal stage each year also suggests that the effect of larval host abundance in any given year should penetrate only to the next year and not beyond.

					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040145-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d; indicate that NIP varies strongly with variable species composition in the community of hosts for larval ticks. Consequently, an impact of acorns but not of single host species would be expected if acorns alter the species composition in the host community. In addition to mice and chipmunks, acorns are likely to influence abundance and space use by gray squirrels

When we included candidate climate variables, deer indices, and larval tick density together with densities of mice, chipmunks, and acorns, our model comparison methods never selected models incorporating climate, deer, or larvae and always selected models with either rodents, acorns, or both, as explanatory variables. Effects of variable climate or deer abundance on Lyme-disease risk might achieve statistical significance without being biologically important if statistical models fail to assess more potent independent variables. It remains possible that variable climate and deer abundance affect large-scale spatial variation in Lyme-disease risk even if their impacts on temporal variability are weak. Our long-term studies of Lyme-disease risk at the epicenter of the epidemic in North America strongly implicate a role for population density of rodent hosts and their food resources. We suggest that masting indices could be used to alert the public when years of high Lyme-disease risk are anticipated.

					<sub>corr</sub> of their regression models to the AIC
					<sub>corr</sub> value of an intercept-only (i.e., mean) model. The 11 independent variables included two temperature variables, two precipitation variables, two indices of deer abundance, abundance of larval ticks, acorn abundance, and three measures of small mammal abundance. We checked for colinearity among the independent variables using correlation coefficients. Because there were missing values for some variables in some years and plots, the univariate models were compared against mean models estimated with the same subset of (nonmissing) observations. We then tested series of increasingly complex models by combining sets of independent variables for which there was evidence (as measured by AIC) of univariate effects. Our choices for the forms of the multiple regression models were guided by the dictates of parsimony: while our dataset represents an enormous sampling effort over a 13-y period, the actual sample sizes (a given plot in a given year) were still relatively small, ranging from 42 to 58 observations for the various models.
				</p><p>We used simulated annealing (a global optimization algorithm) to find the maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters of each model. The observations were assumed to be normally distributed with a homogeneous variance. Examination of the residuals indicates that this assumption was appropriate for all three of the response variables. The specific annealing algorithm we used (based on Goffe et al. &#x0005b;
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040145-b065">65</xref>&#x0005d;) allows a bounded search in cases where a range of parameter values is either mathematically inconsistent or biologically unreasonable (i.e., negative densities or variance estimates). The sample locations were widely enough distributed that we are confident in assuming that the error terms in our models are spatially independent, and there was no evidence of temporal autocorrelation in the residuals. The simulated annealing and all of the statistical analyses were done using R (
