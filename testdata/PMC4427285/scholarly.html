            <p>Scarce information on outcomes of epidemic post infectious glomerulonephritis is available.
               This is a 10-year follow-up of the patients that developed acute glomerulonephritis
               in an epidemic outbreak caused by group C Streptococcus zooepidemicus in Brazil in
               1998, that were also previously evaluated 2 and 5 years after the acute episode.

         <div tagxxx="sec">
            <title>Methods</title>
            <p>In this prospective study 60 cases (out of 134 in 1998) were reevaluated after 10
               years, as well as community controls matched by gender and age. They underwent clinical
               and renal function evaluation, including serum creatinine and cystatin C, estimated
               glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), albuminuria and hematuria.

            <title>Results</title>
            <p>Comparisons of clinical and renal function aspects of 60 patients and 48 community
               controls have not shown significant differences (eGFR &lt;60 ml/min/1.73m

               except for a higher frequency of hypertension in the cases (45.0% vs. 20.8%, p = 0.009).
               Comparing the same patients affected in the acute episode, 2, 5 and 10 years later,
               it was observed an improvement of median eGFR levels at 2 years and a trend toward
               subsequent stabilization in these levels, associated with decrease in albuminuria
               and increased hypertension rates in the last survey. At 10 years it was not observed
               additional reduction of renal function using serum creatinine, eGFR and cystatin C.

            <title>Conclusions</title>
            <p>During the acute episode of epidemic GN a considerable proportion of patients presented
               hypertension and reduced renal function; after 2 years and particularly at this 10-year
               follow-up survey there was no worsening of renal function parameters, except for persistent
               higher frequency of hypertension. Nevertheless, a longer follow up is necessary to
               confirm that progressive loss of renal function will not occur.

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>In Brazil a large outbreak of acute glomerulonephritis (GN) occurred in 1998, associated
            to unpasteurized milk, when 253 cases of acute GN were reported in the state of Minas
            Gerais (central Western country region) [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0125313.ref001">

               </sup>
            </span>]. Clinical presentation involved fever, headache, and myalgia, followed by cervical
            adenopathy. After 7 to 10 days, patients developed GN, characterized by oliguria,
            hematuria, generalized edema, and hypertension, mostly in adults. Nine individuals
            were initially submitted to renal biopsy that showed diffuse proliferative pattern
            consistent with post infectious GN. Serologic assays for cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr
            virus, arboviruses (including dengue), coxsackie viruses B1-6, yellow fever, Rocio
            virus, Andes hantavirus, Puumula virus, and Sin Nombre virus were negative [

            </span>]. Throat cultures indicated that GN was associated with Lancefield group C 
            <i>Streptococcus zooepidemicus</i>, a cause of bovine mastitis. Epidemiological investigation revealed that patients
            had consumed a locally produced cheese prepared with unpasteurized milk [

         <title>Subjects and Methods</title>
         <p>The files of the originally affected patients with their contact addresses and clinical
            information were kept recorded by the local nephrology team under the supervision
            of one of the authors (SWP). After 10 years of the outbreak a new clinical survey
            was conducted and 60 subjects were reevaluated in the present study. In addition,
            a control group was selected in the community; they were neighbors of the cases and
            matched to them by age and gender. The controls lived in the region during the outbreak
            in 1998 and did not have symptoms or signs of the disease at that occasion.
         </p>
         <p>Participants provide their written informed consent to participate in this study,
            that was approved by the ethics committee of the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais.
         </p>
         <p>The medical team visited the cases and controls in their homes, collected the clinical
            information, and obtained early morning blood and urine samples for analyses. During
            each visit, a recently voided urine sample was collected for dipstick test (Combur
            10 Test M; Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and albuminuria assessment; a blood sample was
            drawn (usually after fasting); an interim history was obtained; and a physical examination
            was performed. Blood pressure was measured with a mercury sphygmomanometer, while
            the patient was in the sitting position after 5 minutes of rest. The average of 3
            measurements taken with a 1-minute interval was used in the analysis. Hypertension
            was defined when systolic blood pressure was higher or equal to 140 mmHg or diastolic
            blood pressure was higher or equal to 90 mmHg, or use of antihypertensive medication.
            Blood and urine samples were appropriately stored at 4Â°C and brought to the reference
            study laboratory. When examined within 1 day, urine samples were kept at 4Â°C; otherwise,
            they were frozen at â20Â°C. Blood samples were examined for serum creatinine (alkaline
            picrate method) and cystatin C (nephelometry, BN2-Siemens equipment, Siemens Brasil,
            SP. Serum creatinine was measured in the same laboratory and using the same methodology
            in all surveys performed since 1998. Albuminuria was assessed by nephelometry with
            Image-Beckman Coulter (Inc. Diagnostics Division Headquarters, Brea, CA) and values
            were considered abnormal if greater than 30 mg/g creatinine. GFR was estimated (eGFR)
            based on serum creatinine (eGFR-creatinine) by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
            (MDRD) study equation, and based on serum cystatin C by the equation eGFR-cys = 76.7
            x cystatin C
            <sup>-1.19</sup>. GFR was considered reduced when lower than 60 mL/min/1.73m
            <sup>2</sup>.

         <div tagxxx="sec">
            <h3>Statistical analysis</h3>
            <p>The chi-square test or Fisherâs exact test were used for the comparison of categorical
               variables. Studentâs t-test or the MannâWhitney tests (whenever appropriate) were
               used for the comparison of continuous variables. In the longitudinal analysis that
               involved eGFR in the years of 1998 (outbreak), 2000 (after 2 years), 2003 (after 5
               years), and 2008 (after 10 years) the tests of Friedman and Wilcoxon were applied
               for numerical variables and the McNemarâs for categorical variables. Analysis of covariance
               was used to compare mean values of variables adjusted for age and gender. Tests were
               two-sided and statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05. The software used was the
               SPSS v. 15.0.

         <title>Results</title>
         <p>Of the 134 confirmed cases of PSGN seen in 1998, 13 died: three in the acute phase
            of illness (the causes of death were sepsis, cerebrovascular accident and respiratory
            failure, respectively), six after resolution of the acute illness, with normal renal
            function (due to congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular
            accident and unknown causes), and four died on chronic dialysis program. Eleven cases
            required dialysis during the acute phase of illness and 3 of these died within 1 month
            of disease; 3 recovered renal function and stopped dialysis before 3 months of disease;
            5 of them remained on chronic dialysis; of these, four died after more than 2 years
            on dialysis.
         </p>
         <p>After 10 years of the outbreak, considering the remaining 121 patients some cases
            could not be located (n = 52) or did not agree to undergo another medical evaluation
            (n = 9), thus leaving 60 cases for the current study. These cases did not differ at
            presentation from those not re-examined regarding several characteristics such as:
            mean age, gender, hospitalization rate, presence of edema, mean systolic and diastolic
            blood pressure, serum creatinine levels, and need for dialysis. We confirmed that
            during the follow-up, none of the non-reevaluated cases died or underwent chronic
            dialysis in the dialysis centers of the state of Minas Gerais.
         </p>
         <p>During the acute phase, renal biopsy was performed in nine patients. All specimens
            showed âdiffuse proliferative glomerulonephritisâ as expected in a context of PSGN.
            No patients received immunosuppressive drug therapy in the acute phase of disease;
            however, diuretics and anti-hypertensive drugs were frequently used. Immunosuppression
            including the use of glucocorticosteroids was never prescribed during the entire observation
            period of 10 years.
         </p>
         <p>Gender and age of patients and controls, as well as blood pressure measurements and
            laboratory parameters at follow-up are shown in

            acute renal failure and 3.7% (n = 5/134) with end-stage renal disease, that represent
            a relatively high rate of loss of renal function in the acute phase of this post infectious
            GN.
         </p>
         <p>One of the strengths of this study is the use of serum creatinine, eGFR based on serum
            creatinine and serum cystatin C as additional tools to evaluate more precisely the
            renal function [

               </sup>
            </span>] of this population. Using these markers, considered more sensitive than the absolute
            levels of serum creatinine to detect reduced GFR, it is possible to assure that a
            functional recuperation of renal function occurred along the years in the great majority
            of the patients. High median eGFR rates were observed at the time of the last laboratory
            assessment. Additional strengths of our report are the prospective study design and
            the long-term follow-up of this cohort.
         </p>
         <p>As eventual study limitations is necessary to emphasize that the case ascertainment
            methods used in the earlier phase of such outbreak possibly would not have identified
            those cases that did not need hospital admission or referral to a nephrologist. Therefore,
            it is possible that we have studied cases with more severe symptoms and presentation.
            In addition, despite our efforts, we were not able to reexamine several patients initially
            affected, however their baseline characteristics were not different from those reassessed
            and we confirmed that none initiated chronic dialysis in the region during the follow-up.
            Overall, this sample had a low frequency of risk factors for adverse renal outcomes,
            as reflected in the very satisfactory renal function results. Also notable is the
            increasing use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor
            blockers by the cases (12.5% at 5-yr and 28.3% at 10-yr follow-up), which have contributed
            to the preservation of kidney function.

         <p>Besides the heterogeneity of the studies of PSGN most of them with group A streptococci
            makes comparison among available reports difficult. Even in group A cases short-term

         <p>Especially for its preventable nature, the possible contribution of episodes of acute
            PSGN to increased risk of chronic kidney disease in later life is a matter of concern.
            This was investigated in an Aboriginal community in Australia [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0125313.ref021">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>]. Of 1519 residents, 200 had had at least one episode of PSGN, usually in childhood.
            All PSGN episodes were associated with group A streptococcal skin infections, often
            related to scabies. The authors concluded that PSGN contributes to the very serious
            burden of chronic kidney disease in that community. They observed, for instance, that
            PSGN (5 years or more earlier) was significantly associated with higher levels of
            albuminuria (vs. individuals without previous PSGN) and, in women aged 30â39 years
            a history of PSGN was associated with a significantly higher frequency of eGFR &lt;60
            ml/min.
         </p>
         <p>Post infectious GN including PSGN in their different presentations are current kidney
            health problems all over the world, as a typical acute PSGN of childhood predominantly
            in developing countries or involving older adults in the industrialized ones.
         </p>
         <p>Considering our studies and few others it is necessary to be aware to the possibility
            of 
            <i>S</i>. 
            <i>zooepidemicus</i> as the etiological agent of acute PSGN, transmitted to humans by unpasteurized dairy
            products, and affecting mostly adults, as demonstrated in this and other outbreaks.
         </p>
         <p>Long-term reports on epidemic PSGN are scarce, reinforcing the relevance of following
            during 10 years this population affected by an 
            <i>S</i>. 
            <i>zooepidemicus</i> outbreak leading to PSGN. In the present study it is noteworthy that after the acute
            phase, characterized by severe clinical manifestations of this epidemic PSGN (as acute
            renal failure requiring dialysis, progression to end-stage renal disease, documented
            crescentic GN), it was observed a trend toward maintenance of renal function instead
            of progressive loss, especially after 2 years.
         </p>
         <p>Nevertheless, it is still possible that part of these patients have lost a substantial
            proportion of their nephrons during the acute glomerulonephritis episode and may have
            reduced nephron mass. The apparent slight improvement in eGFR at 10 years may be partly
            the consequence of glomerular hyperperfusion/ hyperfiltration injury, particularly
            considering the increasing percentage of patients with hypertension at this point.
            Thus, it is still necessary a longer follow-up to dismiss possible deleterious effects
            of PSGN.
