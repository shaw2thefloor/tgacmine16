         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Miliary tuberculosis is a rare form of a tuberculosis infection that results from
            massive lymphohematogenous dissemination of the mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli.
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-imcrj-8-099">

               </sup>
            </span> This form of infection, which accounts for 2.8% of all tuberculosis infections, usually
            involves the extrapulmonary organs.
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-imcrj-8-099">

            </span> From extrapulmonary tuberculosis only 22% affects the genitourinary system, while
            tuberculosis of the prostate gland is seen in only 2.7% of genitourinary tuberculosis.

            </span> Due to the rare involvement of the prostate, very scarce literature of the subject,
            and non-specific symptoms, the clinical suspicion of prostate tuberculosis is difficult.
            Here we report a case of a young, previously healthy, immunocompetent patient with
            miliary tuberculosis involving the prostate.
         </p>

         <title>Case report</title>
         <p>We present a case of a 32-year-old immunocompetent Iranian male who presented to the
            emergency room with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure lasting for 3 minutes. He denied
            any history of trauma, fever, or previous seizures. Furthermore, he did not have any
            genitourinary symptoms, including dysuria, hematuria, or penile discharge. A computerized
            tomography (CT) scan of the head failed to show any acute central nervous system insult.
         </p>
         <p>After that, the patient was admitted to the hospital. Prior to this admission, he
            gave history of an admission 12 months ago to a hospital outside the country, where
            he complained of fatigue, weight loss, and fever. Reports from the hospital showed
            that he also had chronic moderate ascites and a left pleural effusion. However, several
            laboratory and imaging tests were done and it was concluded that there was no evidence
            of infectious disease, chronic liver disease, or malignancy. It was recommended that
            he may need more investigations or a laparoscopy with peritoneal tissue biopsy, which
            was not done.
         </p>
         <p>Upon the latest admission, the respiratory rate was 12 breaths per minute, the body
            temperature was 36.9°C, and the blood pressure was 112/70 mmHg. The patient had mild
            tachycardia of 109 beats per minute. Physical examination was unremarkable including
            the respiratory system examination. Digital rectal examination was not performed since
            the patient did not have any genitourinary or gastrointestinal symptoms. During this
            hospitalization, the patient received anti-epileptic treatments and multiple investigations
            were done. The laboratory investigations, urine routine and microscopy, cultures,
            virology screen, including human immunodeficiency virus, as well as the autoimmune
            markers did not show any significant issues. Also, three sets of sputum acid-fast
            bacilli smears were done, which were all negative. Further invasive tests were performed
            including endoscopy and colonoscopy which were unremarkable. A lumber puncture was
            also performed with a normal initial pressure, 0 mm³cell count, glucose of 4.1 mm
            per liters, and protein of 764 mg per liter. At the same time the serum glucose was
            6 mmol per liter. A magnetic resonance image of the brain was done concluding multifocal
            enhancing foci suggestive of an infective process (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="f1-imcrj-8-099">Figure 1</span>).
         </p>
         <p>Due to his previous history, CT-chest, abdomen, and pelvis were also done. The chest-CT
            was unremarkable. The abdominal CT showed mild peritoneal ascites with evidence of
            mild splenomegaly. The ascetic fluid taken was translucent and yellow in color and
            the serum-ascites albumin gradient 5 gram per liter (0.5 gram per deciliter). Furthermore,
            the analysis was negative for Ziehl–Neelsen, gram stain, and culture.
         </p>
         <p>The pelvis CT also showed an enlargement of the prostate and a right prostate lesion
            extending to the seminal vesicles (faint ring enhancing lesion measuring 3×2.7×3 cm)
            (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="f2-imcrj-8-099">Figure 2</span>).
         </p>
         <p>The case was discussed with the patient and he agreed to start anti-tuberculosis treatment
            and to have a trans-rectal biopsy of the prostate. The biopsy showed multiple slides
            of necrotizing granulomata suggestive of tuberculosis (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="f3-imcrj-8-099">Figure 3</span>). Ziehl–Neelsen stain was also performed, and the diagnosis of miliary tuberculosis
            was confirmed (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="f4-imcrj-8-099">Figure 4</span>).
         </p>
         <p>He was started on anti-tuberculosis therapy with isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol,
            pyrazinamide, and pyridoxine for 12 months. At follow-up the prostate biopsy tubercle
            bacilli culture result came back positive. The patient was asymptomatic with a normal
            physical examination and laboratory tests with no drug side effects.

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>Miliary tuberculosis is the widespread dissemination of mycobacterium tuberculosis
            by means of lymphohematogenous spread. This complication is seen in 1%–3% of all tuberculosis
            cases.
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-imcrj-8-099">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#b5-imcrj-8-099">5</a>
               </sup>
            </span> Although most cases of miliary tuberculosis are treatable, the mortality rate among
            young adults with miliary tuberculosis remains 15% –20% and for adults 25%–30%.
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-imcrj-8-099">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#b2-imcrj-8-099">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span> One of the main causes for these high mortality rates includes late detection of
            disease caused by non-specific symptoms. These symptoms may be implicated in numerous
            disorders, thus delaying diagnosis.
         </p>
         <p>Tuberculosis of the prostate is rare and the literature is scarce. Most often, the
            cases are under-reported, and easily missed. Patients with prostatic tuberculosis
            usually present with non-specific symptoms except in rare cases. These rare cases
            present with irritative voiding symptoms, terminal dysuria or hemospermia.
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-imcrj-8-099">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#b6-imcrj-8-099">6</a>
               </sup>
            </span> However this was not the case in our patient. The patient was asymptomatic and like
            most cases in the literature, tuberculosis of the prostate was diagnosed incidentally.
            As in our case, tuberculosis of the prostate is mainly diagnosed by pathologists where
            a trans-rectal ultrasound guided biopsy of the prostate is the mainstay of the diagnosis.
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-imcrj-8-099">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span> As Wang and Chang have demonstrated, it was the clinical usefulness of the contrast
            enhanced CT for the diagnosis of tuberculosis of the prostate in which low density
            multiple and bilateral lesions with irregular borders are seen that prompted us to
            further investigate the prostate.

                  <a href="#b8-imcrj-8-099">8</a>
               </sup>
            </span> Once the disease is diagnosed, the patient should receive a full course of anti-tubercular
            therapy.

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>The presentation of miliary tuberculosis infection is highly variable. Often, the
            presentation can be non-specific and misleading, as in our case. A strong clinical
            suspicion and availability of sophisticated tests with confirmation by biopsy, polymerase
            chain reaction, and culture are needed in order to avoid misdiagnosis of complicated
            miliary tuberculosis cases.
