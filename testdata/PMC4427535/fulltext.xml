Over 970 Kenyan-based HCWs have completed an eight-modular online training free of charge (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.marps-africa.org">http://www.marps-africa.org</uri>) since its creation in 2011. Before updating these modules, we performed a systematic review of published literature of MSM studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa (sSA) in the period 2011&#x02013;2014, to investigate if recent studies provided: important new knowledge currently not addressed in existing online modules; contested information of existing module topics; or added depth to topics covered already. We used learning objectives of the eight existing modules to categorise data from the literature. If data could not be categorised, new modules were suggested. Our review identified 142 MSM studies with data from sSA, including 34 studies requiring module updates, one study contesting current content, and 107 studies reinforcing existing module content. ART adherence and community engagement were identified as new modules. Recent MSM studies conducted in sSA provided new knowledge, contested existing information, and identified new areas of MSM service needs currently unaddressed in the online training.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ART adherence</kwd><kwd>Community engagement</kwd><kwd>Healthcare worker</kwd><kwd>MSM sensitivity training</kwd><kwd>Sub-Saharan Africa</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Men who have sex with men (MSM) in sub-Saharan Africa (sSA) are at high risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and require urgent interventions to reduce acquisition and transmission.<sup><xref rid="IHU101C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> However, as a result of discriminatory legislation, many African countries do not recognise or address the needs of MSM in the context of national HIV/AIDS prevention and control programmes.<sup><xref rid="IHU101C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Grass roots initiatives in several African countries, and stakeholder consultations have started to shape comprehensive services and HIV preventive research agenda for MSM.<sup><xref rid="IHU101C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="IHU101C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Although WHO recently provided consolidated guidelines on the <italic>Prevention, Diagnosis, Treatment and Care of Key Populations</italic>,<sup><xref rid="IHU101C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> acceptance of MSM as equal citizens entitled to quality healthcare and prevention information is still in jeopardy in most African countries.<sup><xref rid="IHU101C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>As MSM are stigmatised in society and in healthcare facilities, they face substantial barriers to accessing healthcare services,<sup><xref rid="IHU101C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="IHU101C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and care seeking is often delayed.<sup><xref rid="IHU101C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Front-line healthcare workers (HCWs) in sSA do not receive basic training on how to counsel MSM clients, or diagnose and treat rectal STIs.<sup><xref rid="IHU101C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In Kenya, HCWs felt that they must be equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to provide such services.<sup><xref rid="IHU101C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>Until recently, training guides providing information about MSM specifically addressing the needs of front-line HCWs in Africa were rare. In 2009, the Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation in South Africa and the Kenya Medical Research Institute in Kenya, in collaboration with the University of Oxford, developed the manual <italic>MSM: An Introductory Guide for Health Workers in Africa</italic>, based on expert opinion and the limited information available from African MSM studies. This manual was updated in 2011, using literature of MSM studies in sSA available until 2011. The revision received input from external reviewers who were experienced with MSM studies and services in sSA. Soon after revision of the manual in 2011, WHO released guidelines on the <italic>Prevention and Treatment of HIV and other Sexually Transmitted Infections among MSM and Transgender People</italic>.<sup><xref rid="IHU101C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>The training comprises eight modules: MSM and HIV in sub-Saharan Africa; Homophobia: stigma and its effects; Sexual identity, coming out and disclosure; Anal sex and common sexual practices; HIV and STIs; Condom and lubricant use; Mental health: anxiety, depression and substance use; and Risk-reduction counselling. The online version (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.marps-africa.org">http://www.marps-africa.org</uri>) of the second edition is frequently used in Kenya and over 970 HCWs, including over 420 government HCWs, have completed it, either through self-training or facilitated learning (E. Sanders, personal communication).</p><p>The effect of this training programme upon HCW knowledge and attitudes was evaluated in 71 Kenyan HCWs in 2012, and showed significant improvements in knowledge of MSM sexual health issues and reduced homophobic attitudes up to three months after the training.<sup><xref rid="IHU101C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Didactic content as well as opportunities for group reflection empowered HCWs to discuss MSM behaviour and anal sex. HCWs acknowledged the existence of MSM in their clinics and recognised their own professional responsibility to provide appropriate and effective services. Challenges in the context of broader societal homophobia called for the urgent scale up of such culturally adapted and specialised training programmes for African HCWs.<sup><xref rid="IHU101C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>As the training guide was last updated in 2011 and many studies in African MSM have since been published, we set out to assess if newly published literature on MSM and HIV prevention and care in sSA would require a training guide update. Additionally, by using the eight existing modules of the training guide as a framework we expected to identify new areas of MSM services needs that were unaddressed in the current training guide.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed of peer-reviewed MSM studies conducted in sSA and published from January 2011 to March 2014.

A study conducted among Kenyan MSWs found unexpectedly high levels of self-reported anal sex with women: 65.7% (88/134) had recently had sex with a female client, and 42.9% (108/252) had recently had sex with a non-paying female partner.<sup><xref rid="IHU101C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> For risk assessment, Adebajo et al. demonstrated that MSM assessed by audio computer assisted self-interview (ACASI) were more likely to report high risk sexual behaviour and to self-identify as homosexual than those assessed by face-to-face interviewing.<sup><xref rid="IHU101C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Module 5: HIV and STIs</title><sec id="s3e1"><title>Acute and early HIV infection</title><p>Module 5 includes very limited information on acute HIV-1 infection, and no information on healthcare seeking around the time of HIV-1 seroconversion. While little is known about healthcare seeking around the time of HIV seroconversion in sSA, two studies from coastal Kenya added new information. One study revealed that 69% (50/72) of adults (of which most men were MSM) seek urgent healthcare when acquiring HIV infection. These individuals are often presumptively treated for malaria.<sup><xref rid="IHU101C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> A second study from coastal Kenya showed that six characteristics of a risk screening score (i.e., fever, diarrhoea, symptomatic STI, fatigue, age 18&#x02013;29 years and discordant HIV test results) were independent predictors of acute and early HIV-1 acquisition in high risk MSM.<sup><xref rid="IHU101C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="s3e2"><title>Pre-exposure prophylaxis</title><p>Module 5 includes very little information on the use of Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Since 2011, four studies, including two conducted in Kenya, were published on the effectiveness, usage, and acceptability of PrEP in sSA. A phase I randomised controlled trial (RCT) assessing PrEP adherence in MSM and female sex workers (FSWs) over four months demonstrated that intermittent PrEP regimens, particularly coitally-dependent dosing, were more difficult to adhere to than daily dosing regimens.<sup><xref rid="IHU101C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Conducting qualitative assessments of selected MSM and FSWs from the afore mentioned trial, Van der Elst et al. reported high PrEP acceptability among Kenyan MSM and FSWs, but described challenges in adherence and use.<sup><xref rid="IHU101C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Acceptability of PrEP was also reported to be high among potential user groups (including MSM) in a large survey conducted in seven countries.<sup><xref rid="IHU101C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> A secondary analysis of a phase III multi-country RCT of PrEP efficacy displayed how PrEP would be most effective at the population level if targeted toward only those MSM and transgender women who report unprotected receptive anal intercourse.<sup><xref rid="IHU101C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="s3e3"><title>Other STIs</title><p>Module 5 provides very limited information on what HCWs should do when MSM present with an STI, including treatment recommendations for urethral or rectal discharge.

An osmolality analysis of lubricants contributed to the assessment of lubricant safety, showing that many of the water-based sexual lubricants available in South Africa are hyperosmolar and therefore may cause epithelial damage and potentially increase HIV transmission.<sup><xref rid="IHU101C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Module 7: Mental health: anxiety, depression and substance abuse</title><p>Module 7 contains no information on risk factors for poor mental health outcomes for MSM and, to our knowledge, no formal assessment of mental health issues has been conducted in MSM in Africa. In a recent survey focusing on psychological factors associated with unprotected anal intercourse in South Africa, 56.6% of MSM scored symptoms of at least a mild depression.<sup><xref rid="IHU101C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Men who had higher scores were more than twice as likely to report unprotected anal intercourse.

Both recommend providing PrEP to MSM as a component of a comprehensive HIV prevention package, including increased availability of condoms and lubricants, regular HIV testing, STI screening, and ART initiation at CD4 counts &#x0003c;500 cells/ml or immediately for specific conditions (i.e., a seronegative partner, active TB disease, hepatitis B virus infection with severe chronic liver disease). Kenya has adopted the recently revised WHO recommendation for ART initiation,<sup><xref rid="IHU101C48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> but will consider the provision of PrEP to MSM only in the context of research.<sup><xref rid="IHU101C49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup></p><p>While national HIV prevention strategies addressing MSM are an essential step towards improving accesss to care for MSM, HCWs experience tension if same sex practices remain criminalised.<sup><xref rid="IHU101C50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> In Malawi, service providers reported concerns of adverse repercussions related to the provision of services to men in same sex sexual practices.<sup><xref rid="IHU101C51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> In coastal Kenya, HCWs who had taken the online MSM training experienced secondary stigma from colleagues who had not been trained.<sup><xref rid="IHU101C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In a two-year post training assessment of MSM services' provision in coastal Kenya, county AIDS coordinators expressed the wish that national government would endorse the MSM sensitivity training for HCWs.<sup><xref rid="IHU101C52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup></p><p>This systematic review has several limitations. First, we included only data derived from published studies in the period 2011&#x02013;2014. By excluding literature published before 2011, we may have missed important data currently not discussed in the current modules, which were developed based primarily on expert opinion. Second, our review was limited to peer-reviewed studies that were published in peer-reviewed journals. We did not conduct a comprehensive MSM training guideline review, or search databases for published reports of non-research programmes or campaigns targeted at African MSM. Such an expanded search would have illustrated potentially some of the pressing healthcare needs of MSM, and impressed on HCWs the significance of the sizes of various MSM groups arising in Africa.</p><p>Despite these limitations, we believe this work is a valuable step towards updating an important training curriculum. HCWs in sSA play a crucial role in reducing stigma and discrimination of MSM. Their knowledge needs to be accurate and up to date. Technical guidance on clinical care for MSM and a comprehensive training curriculum for HCWs working with MSM patients has recently been made available (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.msmgf.org/promotinghealth">http://www.msmgf.org/promotinghealth</uri>) and an introductory manual on <italic>Health Care Provision for MSM, Sex Workers, and People Who Inject Drugs</italic> has been developed in South Africa in 2013.<sup><xref rid="IHU101C53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> Front-line HCWs in sSA would benefit from an accessible and basic introductory training manual that is tailored specifically to their region.
