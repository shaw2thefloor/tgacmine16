         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>Sensitivity training of front-line African health care workers (HCWs) attending to
            men who have sex with men (MSM) is actively promoted through national HIV prevention
            programming in Kenya. Over 970 Kenyan-based HCWs have completed an eight-modular online
            training free of charge (
            <div tagxxx="uri">http://www.marps-africa.org</div>) since its creation in 2011. Before updating these modules, we performed a systematic
            review of published literature of MSM studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa (sSA)
            in the period 2011–2014, to investigate if recent studies provided: important new
            knowledge currently not addressed in existing online modules; contested information
            of existing module topics; or added depth to topics covered already. We used learning
            objectives of the eight existing modules to categorise data from the literature. If
            data could not be categorised, new modules were suggested. Our review identified 142
            MSM studies with data from sSA, including 34 studies requiring module updates, one
            study contesting current content, and 107 studies reinforcing existing module content.
            ART adherence and community engagement were identified as new modules. Recent MSM
            studies conducted in sSA provided new knowledge, contested existing information, and
            identified new areas of MSM service needs currently unaddressed in the online training.

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Men who have sex with men (MSM) in sub-Saharan Africa (sSA) are at high risk for HIV
            and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and require urgent interventions
            to reduce acquisition and transmission.

         <p>Until recently, training guides providing information about MSM specifically addressing
            the needs of front-line HCWs in Africa were rare. In 2009, the Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation
            in South Africa and the Kenya Medical Research Institute in Kenya, in collaboration
            with the University of Oxford, developed the manual 
            <i>MSM: An Introductory Guide for Health Workers in Africa</i>, based on expert opinion and the limited information available from African MSM studies.
            This manual was updated in 2011, using literature of MSM studies in sSA available
            until 2011. The revision received input from external reviewers who were experienced
            with MSM studies and services in sSA. Soon after revision of the manual in 2011, WHO
            released guidelines on the 
            <i>Prevention and Treatment of HIV and other Sexually Transmitted Infections among MSM
               and Transgender People
            </i>.

         <p>The training comprises eight modules: MSM and HIV in sub-Saharan Africa; Homophobia:
            stigma and its effects; Sexual identity, coming out and disclosure; Anal sex and common
            sexual practices; HIV and STIs; Condom and lubricant use; Mental health: anxiety,
            depression and substance use; and Risk-reduction counselling. The online version (
            <div tagxxx="uri">http://www.marps-africa.org</div>) of the second edition is frequently used in Kenya and over 970 HCWs, including over
            420 government HCWs, have completed it, either through self-training or facilitated
            learning (E. Sanders, personal communication).
         </p>
         <p>The effect of this training programme upon HCW knowledge and attitudes was evaluated
            in 71 Kenyan HCWs in 2012, and showed significant improvements in knowledge of MSM
            sexual health issues and reduced homophobic attitudes up to three months after the
            training.

            </sup> Didactic content as well as opportunities for group reflection empowered HCWs to
            discuss MSM behaviour and anal sex. HCWs acknowledged the existence of MSM in their
            clinics and recognised their own professional responsibility to provide appropriate
            and effective services. Challenges in the context of broader societal homophobia called
            for the urgent scale up of such culturally adapted and specialised training programmes
            for African HCWs.

         <p>As the training guide was last updated in 2011 and many studies in African MSM have
            since been published, we set out to assess if newly published literature on MSM and
            HIV prevention and care in sSA would require a training guide update. Additionally,
            by using the eight existing modules of the training guide as a framework we expected
            to identify new areas of MSM services needs that were unaddressed in the current training
            guide.

            </sup> In a two-year post training assessment of MSM services' provision in coastal Kenya,
            county AIDS coordinators expressed the wish that national government would endorse
            the MSM sensitivity training for HCWs.

         <p>This systematic review has several limitations. First, we included only data derived
            from published studies in the period 2011–2014. By excluding literature published
            before 2011, we may have missed important data currently not discussed in the current
            modules, which were developed based primarily on expert opinion. Second, our review
            was limited to peer-reviewed studies that were published in peer-reviewed journals.
            We did not conduct a comprehensive MSM training guideline review, or search databases
            for published reports of non-research programmes or campaigns targeted at African
            MSM. Such an expanded search would have illustrated potentially some of the pressing
            healthcare needs of MSM, and impressed on HCWs the significance of the sizes of various
            MSM groups arising in Africa.
         </p>
         <p>Despite these limitations, we believe this work is a valuable step towards updating
            an important training curriculum. HCWs in sSA play a crucial role in reducing stigma
            and discrimination of MSM. Their knowledge needs to be accurate and up to date. Technical
            guidance on clinical care for MSM and a comprehensive training curriculum for HCWs
            working with MSM patients has recently been made available (
            <div tagxxx="uri">http://www.msmgf.org/promotinghealth</div>) and an introductory manual on 
            <i>Health Care Provision for MSM, Sex Workers, and People Who Inject Drugs</i> has been developed in South Africa in 2013.

            manual that is tailored specifically to their region. This online manual has proven
            to be effective both in reducing homoprejudice and increasing knowledge.

            <h3>Conclusions</h3>
            <p>Recent studies on MSM conducted in sSA provided new knowledge, contested existing
               information, and identified ART adherence and community engagement involving MSM as
               new topics for training. Given that the online training programme is regularly used,
               with over 970 Kenyan HCWs graduating since 2011, and is actively promoted by the National
               STI and AIDS Control Programme (NASCOP) in Kenya (
               <div tagxxx="uri">http://nascop.or.ke/</div>), an update of training materials would be beneficial.
