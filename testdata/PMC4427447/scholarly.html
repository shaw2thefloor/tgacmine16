            <p>In the past few decades, several researchers have proposed highly accurate prediction
               models that have typically relied on climate parameters. However, climate factors
               can be unreliable and can lower the effectiveness of prediction when they are applied
               in locations where climate factors do not differ significantly. The purpose of this
               study was to improve a dengue surveillance system in areas with similar climate by
               exploiting the infection rate in the 
               <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquito and using the support vector machine (SVM) technique for forecasting the
               dengue morbidity rate.

            <title>Methods and Findings</title>
            <p>Areas with high incidence of dengue outbreaks in central Thailand were studied. The
               proposed framework consisted of the following three major parts: 1) data integration,
               2) model construction, and 3) model evaluation. We discovered that the 
               <i>Ae</i>. 
               <i>aegypti</i> female and larvae mosquito infection rates were significantly positively associated
               with the morbidity rate. Thus, the increasing infection rate of female mosquitoes
               and larvae led to a higher number of dengue cases, and the prediction performance
               increased when those predictors were integrated into a predictive model. In this research,
               we applied the SVM with the radial basis function (RBF) kernel to forecast the high
               morbidity rate and take precautions to prevent the development of pervasive dengue
               epidemics. The experimental results showed that the introduced parameters significantly
               increased the prediction accuracy to 88.37% when used on the test set data, and these
               parameters led to the highest performance compared to state-of-the-art forecasting
               models.

            reduce morbidity and mortality. Several factors are included in the models, including
            climate variables, mosquito density, human populations, demographic transitions, places
            (e.g., school, home, or hospital), and areas (e.g., towns and rural areas). Of these,
            climate or weather variables, particularly rainfall and temperature, are the most
            commonly used variables to increase the forecasting performance of predictive models

            DHF, and many other infectious diseases. Typically, a time series analysis technique
            involves homogeneous data over long periods. The main drawback of this method is that
            it does not consider other variables that are associated with the dependent parameter.
            Nonetheless, many research studies have revealed that the severity of dengue outbreaks
            is influenced by several independent variables, and particularly by climate factors.
            Therefore, a time series analysis may be less reliable because it only considers the

                     data cleaning, transformation, categorization, and scaling. As a result, 648 samples
                     remained.

                     classification algorithms were deployed in the models, and the predicted results were
                     compared and analyzed. The SVM was selected because it has been proven to provide
                     a better performance and processing time compared to the NN and has a good generalization
                     performance [

                     model effectiveness. The cross-validation procedure can prevent the problem of overfitting.
                     Because changing the parameters of the SVM directly affects the values of sensitivity,
                     specificity, and overall accuracy, it is important to determine the optimal parameters
                     to obtain the highest accuracy with a good sensitivity and specificity.

               improperly formatted, or duplicated. These data should be removed from the model because
               they can lower the classification or forecasting power. Because data come from various
               sources, their format and structure are often different and not ready to be processed.
               Therefore, they need to be restructured into a format that the SVM tools can execute.
               In this experiment, all data were transformed into a CSV format. In addition, both
               techniques require that each data point is represented as a vector of a real number.
               Hence, a categorical variable, e.g., province and season, must be converted into a
               numerical value. Here, season was converted into

            <p>We hypothesized that the

               <i>aegypti</i> infection rate was associated with the morbidity rate of dengue outbreaks. Therefore,
               we initially studied the relationship between these parameters by plotting the line

               <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0125049.g002">Fig 2</span>, compared to the plot of the observed dengue cases. The line chart in 
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0125049.g002">Fig 2 (A) and 2 (C)</span> demonstrates that the trends of observed dengue cases and female mosquito infection
               rates fluctuated similarly. These trends show that they were positively correlated
               with the observed dengue cases. In contrast, the infected male mosquitoes and the
               dengue cases are divergent, and thus, they are potentially not associated with each
               other. The climate factors seemed to be less associated with the observed data, except
               for the rainfall amount (

               <p>Because different data attributes have different numeric ranges, greater numeric ranges
                  can dominate those with smaller numeric ranges. Thus, scaling techniques are required

               <h3>SVM with RBF kernel parameter analysis</h3>
               <p>There are two parameters for the RBF kernel: 
                  <i>C</i> and 
                  <i>σ</i>
                  <sup>2</sup>, in which 
                  <i>C</i> is the parameter for regularization, determining the trade-off between the fitting
                  error minimization and the smoothness of the estimated function. The second parameter,
                  
                  <i>σ</i>
                  <sup>2</sup>, is the kernel function parameter. There is no a structural way to select the optimal
                  values of

                  <i>σ</i>

                  because it produced the highest predictive accuracy (96.296%) and the lowest MAE (0.037).
                  Based on these results, the optimal SVM-RBF predictive model was defined by a value

                  of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy than in the second model. This result suggests
                  that the omitted infected female mosquito and infected larvae variables significantly
                  affected the prediction performance. It was noted that the SVM-R had the highest prediction
                  accuracy, up to 96.296%, among all the models. Therefore, this confirms the superior
                  predictive power of the RBF kernel of SVM compared to other kernels using optimal
                  parameters from the previous experiment of this study.

                  <i>KNN</i>, DT, and standard back propagation NN. These techniques are popular and have been
                  applied in several research areas such as image processing, business data mining,
                  and medicine. The collected data were completely separated (no overlapping instances)
                  into a training set and a test set. To avoid model overfitting, a 10-fold cross validation
                  was deployed.

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>The results of this study illustrated that the infection rates in female mosquitoes
            and larvae influenced the number of dengue cases in three provinces of Thailand. 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0125049.g002">Fig 2(A)</span> indicates that the female mosquito infection rate is strongly related to the number
            of observed dengue cases because they have similar line chart trends and because female
            mosquitoes typically forage and bite humans. Transovarially infected mosquitoes are
            known to be capable of transmitting the virus through biting [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0125049.ref040">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#pone.0125049.ref040">40</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Thus, a higher female mosquito infection rate results in higher biting activity
            rates, and, consequently, more dengue cases. In contrast to 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0125049.g002">Fig 2(B)</span>, the dengue cases were not clearly associated with the male mosquito infection rate
            because their trends were divergent. Male mosquitoes do not hunt; therefore, the number
            of dengue cases may not be linked to the male mosquito infection rate. 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0125049.g002">Fig 2(C)</span> revealed that the high infection rate of 
            <i>Ae</i>. 
            <i>aegypti</i> larvae mosquitoes found in the summer was correlated to the high number of dengue
            cases in the following rainy season. When the infection rate of larvae declines, the
            morbidity rate is also lower. This phenomenon occurs repeatedly every year because
            a high infection rate of larvae in the summer leads to a high infection rate of female
            mosquitoes in the following rainy season. This result supports the report of Scott
            
            <i>et al</i>. [

            </span>] regarding the largest female populations being present in the rainy season (May-June)
            in Thailand. As a result, the biting activity rate for female mosquitoes increases
            and, consequently, more dengue cases occur. Thus, the larva infection rate in the
            summer was also positively correlated with the number of observed cases in the following
            rainy season. This discovery is very useful because it is a significant signal that
            indicates the severity of dengue outbreaks in the near future. In other words, if
            we know the infection rate of 
            <i>Ae</i>. 
            <i>aegypti</i> larvae in the summer, we can effectively predict the dengue incidence in the following
            rainy season. The amount of rainfall also seems to be associated with the number of
            cases, which results in a pattern that is similar to the pattern for the number of
            dengue cases, as shown in 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0125049.g002">Fig 2</span> (D). The large volumes of standing water on private properties can revive mosquito
            eggs and subsequently create a surge in the emergence of infected mosquitoes. While

            the data shown in 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0125049.g002">Fig 2E–2G</span> seem negatively associated with the observed number of dengue cases. This result
            occurs primarily because the studied areas are geographically similar, and thus, those
            climate factors are not very different. Therefore, the biting activity rates of the
            
            <i>Ae</i>. 
            <i>aegypti</i> females in the studied areas are similar. As such, using only climate factors will
            lead to poorly predictive results.

               <a href="#pone.0125049.t003">Table 3</a>
            </span> shows the importance of using the scaling method before forecasting data using various
            SVM kernels. The SVM-L and SVM-P suffered from high computational costs compared to
            the SVM-R because both SVM kernels depend on inner products of feature vectors (Eq
            
            <span ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0125049.e001">1</span> and 
            <span ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0125049.e002">2</span>). Therefore, these kernels are typically confronted with numerical problems due to
            the large difference of numeric ranges in the feature vectors. For example, the population
            size in each province in this study included over 100,000 people, while the mosquito
            infection rate was less than 100. In this case, the population density has a wide
            range of values, and the distance will be governed by this particular feature. Therefore,
            standardizing the range of all features allows for each feature to contribute in an
            approximately proportional manner to the final distance. The data in this study were
            standardized to the range of the independent variables or the features of the data.
            As a result, the computational time dramatically decreased, and more importantly,
            the prediction power significantly increased. 
            <span ref-type="table" rid="pone.0125049.t003">
               <a href="#pone.0125049.t003">Table 3</a>
            </span> also shows that the prediction performance of the SVM-R increased from 90.74 to 96.29%
            after scaling the data, whereas the computational cost decreased slightly. Because
            computational time is crucial when dealing with large datasets, scaling the data is
            a very useful process for constructing a forecasting model for larger amounts of data
            in the future and for enhancing the prediction efficiency.
         </p>
         <p>When the SVM is chosen as a forecasting technique for the dengue severity level prediction,
            we need to first consider what kernel function is the most suitable for the dengue
            data. A dynamic feature of the data used to predict the dengue severity level, e.g.,
            climate factors and the mosquito infection rate, is that they are nonlinear. It has
            been suggested that using nonlinear kernel functions could achieve a better performance
            than linear kernel functions. Therefore, the SVM-R is used as the kernel function
            of SVM because it can effectively handle instances in which the relationship between
            the independent and dependent variables is nonlinear. In addition, the RBF kernel
            has less complexity (
            <span ref-type="table" rid="pone.0125049.t003">
               <a href="#pone.0125049.t003">Table 3</a>
            </span>) than the polynomial kernel because it has less hyperparameters, which influences
            the complexity of model selection. This experiment demonstrates the performance of
            prediction (
            <span ref-type="table" rid="pone.0125049.t003">
               <a href="#pone.0125049.t003">Table 3</a>

            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0125049.ref039">

            </span>] suggested that the RBF kernel will not improve the performance of classification
            when the number of features is very large; in that case, the linear kernel is preferred.
            Selecting the most suitable SVM-R kernel parameters for a predictive model is another
            challenging task of this research. The determinations of the optimal values of two
            important parameters, C and 
            <i>σ</i>
            <sup>2</sup>, for the SVM-R, are shown in 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0125049.g003">Fig 3</span> (A) and 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0125049.g003">3</span> (B). This experiment explains that the performance of the kernel depends on the adjustable
            parameter 
            <i>σ</i>
            <sup>2</sup> and should be carefully tuned to the problem at hand. Manually tuned parameters in
            this study seemed naïve and required a high experimental time. However, only two parameters
            did not need much more computational time than the heuristic methods. In addition,
            C and 
            <i>σ</i>
            <sup>2</sup> are independent, and thus, the grid search can be easily parallelized, while this
            is difficult in several advanced methods because they are iterative processes [

            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>In addition, we compared the SVM-R with other state-of-the-art techniques. The SVR-R
            provided the best values of all the evaluation criteria, sensitivity and specificity
            (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0125049.g004">Fig 4</span>). The NN is an alternative model that can achieve a high prediction performance in
            terms of sensitivity and specificity. However, the SVM-R obtained a higher specificity
            and sensitivity than the NN. The SVM-R often outperforms the NN in practice because
            it addresses the biggest problem of the NN; SVMs are less prone to overfitting. The
            main drawback of the NN is that it has an expensive computational cost due to its
            algorithm complexity and curse of the dimension problem. Learning too much of the
            complexity of the NN results in overfitting the training set [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0125049.ref038">

               </sup>
            </span>]. Another issue to note is that even if the NN solutions used tend to converge, this
            may not result in a unique solution [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0125049.ref042">

               </sup>
            </span>]. Although the DT and 
            <i>KNN</i> are simple and have a reduced computational cost, their prediction powers are significantly
            lower than the NN and SVM. The 
            <i>KNN</i> had a specificity of 0.105, indicating that 10.5% of the high morbidity rate data
            instances were predicted as low morbidity rates, whereas the DT had only 31.6% specificity.
            These results are consistent with 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0125049.g005">Fig 5</span>, which shows that both the DT and 
            <i>KNN</i> techniques obtained low prediction accuracies compared to the others. Among those
            techniques, the SVM-R outperformed the other state-of-the-art techniques measured
            by the maximum, average, and minimum accuracy. In addition, the difference of prediction
            accuracy obtained from the training set and test set of the SVM-R was small (demonstrated
            by the height of the rectangular boxes), which indicates that the model was not overfit.

            </span> suggest the significance of the two introduced predictors for the forecasting model.
            Infected dengue viruses in larvae and female mosquitoes have been demonstrated as
            the main determinants of outbreaks. They can increase the prediction accuracy by 4.32%
            on average for all models. The sensitivity and specificity also have been shown to
            vary depending on those two new parameters because they decrease when these predictors
            are omitted. Therefore, removing these parameters from the predictive model results
            in a decline of all the evaluation criteria, which has never been studied in any previous
            research.
         </p>
         <p>Unlike other state-of-the-art frameworks, the originality and novelty of this work
            was introducing the use of the 
            <i>Ae</i>. 
            <i>aegypti</i> female mosquito and larva infection rates in the forecasting model to extrapolate
            the morbidity rate of DF. Our study results demonstrate that newly introduced predictors
            could effectively signal the risk of epidemics to local authorities in Thailand and
            help to reduce the severity of the outbreak in the country. It provides better prediction
            accuracy compared to state-of-the-art forecasting models such as the NN, DT, and 
            <i>KNN</i> models In addition, the predictive model will inevitably complement and enhance the
            success of national dengue control. However, there are some limitations to our study.
            First, mosquito infection rate data have a limited availability in other areas. Even
            with the impressive efforts of the research team from Chulalongkorn University in
            collecting mosquito data from the studied areas, detecting the dengue virus in mosquitoes
            using the RT-PCR technique is time-consuming and an expensive laboratory cost. It
            was impossible to collect data and obtain the infection rate of mosquitoes for the
            whole country within a limited time (12 months) for this research project, which leads
            to the second limitation; the studied areas were small and fixed. However, the dynamic
            of the morbidity rate in the community is usually influenced by local factors. Therefore,
            the prediction model for a dengue outbreak is usually applicable only to a specific
            study area [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0125049.ref005">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#pone.0125049.ref005">5</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Although the prototype in this research exploits local dengue data, the proposed
            methodology in this research could be applicable for other geographical areas. Furthermore,
            the findings of this research could apply to other viral infectious diseases transmitted
            by mosquitoes, e.g., malaria or yellow fever.
         </p>
         <p>Further studies are suggested to implement the forecasting model as a web-based application
            accessible by a user or non-technical user. All relevant data for prediction should
            be transformed into a data warehouse that is able to rapidly generate reports for
            users, which will also create advantages for supporting decision making by policy
            makers to strengthen dengue control and take precautions to prevent dengue epidemics
            from becoming pervasive.
