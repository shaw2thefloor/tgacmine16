The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (NBs) are discrete nuclear foci that contain several cellular proteins involved in intrinsic antiviral responses against a number of viruses. Accumulating reports have shown the importance of PML as a DNA virus restriction factor and how these pathogens evade this antiviral activity. However, very little information is available regarding the antiviral role of PML against RNA viruses. Dengue virus (DENV) is an RNA emerging mosquito-borne human pathogen affecting millions of individuals each year by causing severe and potentially fatal syndromes. Since no licensed antiviral drug against DENV infection is currently available, it is of great importance to understand the factors mediating intrinsic immunity that may lead to the development of new pharmacological agents that can boost their potency and thereby lead to treatments for this viral disease. In the present study, we investigated the <italic>in vitro</italic> antiviral role of PML in DENV-2 A549 infected cells.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Research was supported by grants from Agencia Nacional de Promoci&#x000f3;n Cient&#x000ed;fica y Tecnol&#x000f3;gica PICT 166 and 517, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient&#x000ed;ficas y T&#x000e9;cnicas (CONICET) and Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA), Argentina.

This group of proteins with potent antiviral properties known collectively as &#x0201c;restriction factors", are constitutively expressed in cells but can also be induced by type I interferon (IFN-I). Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein has been shown to contribute to intrinsic and innate defenses against a broad range of viruses [<xref rid="pone.0125690.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. PML has the ability to form nuclear bodies (NBs) that serve as a hub for the interaction and modification of over 90 cellular proteins. PML-NBs are sub-nuclear structures associated with the nuclear matrix, which have been implicated in numerous cellular processes including transcription, post-translational modifications, oncogenesis, innate immunity, and several antiviral responses [<xref rid="pone.0125690.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The composition of PML-NBs is heterogeneous and includes constitutively expressed essential constituents such as PML protein, IFN-stimulated Sp100 nuclear antigen, death-domain associated protein-6, and really-interesting-new-gene (RING)-finger proteins [<xref rid="pone.0125690.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. PML-NBs range in size from 0.2 to 1.2 &#x003bc;m in diameter [<xref rid="pone.0125690.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and their number and distribution per nucleus vary considerably between 5 and 30 PML-NBs depending on the cell type, cell cycle, and cell condition [<xref rid="pone.0125690.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>PML-NBs have been shown to be an important intrinsic restriction factor and also contribute to innate defense against a broad range of viruses in the absence of IFN induction. However, IFN-I treatment increases the number and size of PML-NBs and enhances its antiviral activity [<xref rid="pone.0125690.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125690.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In turn, many viruses encode products that modify or eliminate PML-NBs in cultured cells. Since their discovery, PML-NBs have been investigated for their role in the virus-host cell interactions of DNA viruses that must replicate in the mammalian cell nucleus [<xref rid="pone.0125690.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125690.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], but more recently attention has been drawn to their antiviral role against RNA viruses. It has been demonstrated that fibroblasts derived from PML-/- mice are much more sensitive to some RNA viruses, such as the rhabdoviruses vesicular stomatitis and rabies virus, and the arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. These and other findings implicate PML in an intrinsic antiviral response of the cell that targets not only DNA but also RNA viruses [<xref rid="pone.0125690.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125690.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Several PML isoforms generated by alternative splicing from a single gene are designated PMLI to PMLVIIb. They share the same N-terminal region, which encodes the TRIM motif (TRIpartite Motif), but differ in their C-terminal region. The variability of the C-terminal part is important for the recruitment of specific interacting partners and for the specific function of each PML isoform [<xref rid="pone.0125690.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125690.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The implication of PML in antiviral defense against DNA and RNA viruses from different families has been demonstrated in cells stably expressing individual PML isoform or in cells depleted for PML by RNA interference [<xref rid="pone.0125690.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In particular, it has been observed that PML III and IV impair the replication of RNA viruses like the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), influenza and rabies virus [<xref rid="pone.0125690.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125690.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125690.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Dengue virus (DENV) is an emerging mosquito-borne human pathogen included in the family <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>. The four DENV serotypes (DENV1-4) affect millions of individuals each year by causing severe and potentially fatal syndromes [<xref rid="pone.0125690.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The virion particle has a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity that codes for a polyprotein, which is co- and posttranslationally processed into three structural proteins (capsid (C), membrane (M), and envelope (E)) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). Since no licensed antiviral drug against DENV infection is currently available and the most advanced DENV vaccine candidate did not meet expectations in a recent large clinical trial [<xref rid="pone.0125690.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], it is of great importance to understand the factors mediating intrinsic immunity which may lead to the development of new pharmacological agents that can boost their potency and thereby lead to treatments for this viral disease.</p><p>In a previous study we have shown the contribution of PML to cellular antiviral defense against arenavirus multiplication [<xref rid="pone.0125690.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

While TRAF-6 expression was not altered at this time point of infection, the level of mRNAs corresponding to IL-6 and IFN-&#x003b2; were significantly upregulated in DENV-2 infected A549 cell cultures. It is worth to note that these effects were not observed in non-replicating UV-inactivated DENV-2 infected A549 cell cultures. This response is expected since the IFN potent antiviral response is initiated immediately after the pathogens enter into the cell and begin to replicate.

Most of the characterized restriction factors have been studied in the context of HIV-1 life cycle and have been described as possessing potent antiretroviral activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0125690.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125690.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In the last years, it was described that PML is implicated in the intrinsic antiviral immunity against different viruses in the absence of IFN-I, however its activity is enhanced by this molecule [<xref rid="pone.0125690.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In the present study, we have explored the possible role of PML as an intrinsic restriction factor against DENV-2.</p><p>First, we evaluated the impact of PML silencing and overexpression on DENV-2 replication. The silencing of all PML isoforms caused about 0.76 log increment in DENV-2 titre, in comparison with virus production obtained when small non-interfering RNAs were used for transfection. On the other hand, the PMLIV isoform overexpression reduced significantly the extracellular DENV-2 production. These results were in accordance with the viral antigen expression observed by immunofluorescence. The PML silencing rendered A549 cell cultures more susceptible to virus propagation and the overexpression of PMLIV highly inhibited the viral antigen expression in infected cells. It is worth to mention that these results were not influenced by the level of apoptosis in these cell cultures.</p><p>Moreover, we analyzed the intracellular localization of PML-NBs during DENV-2 replication. Confocal microscopy images showed that the typical punctuate nuclear staining pattern of PML-NBs was lost during DENV-2 infection. It remains unclear if the disruption of PML-NBs during DENV-2 infection was a consequence of the interaction between a viral component and this restriction factor, as a viral counterpart action against this antiviral cellular activity. Furthermore, confocal images showed a weak viral protein signal in neighboring cells, which also displayed increased number and size of PML-NBs.</p><p>The next step was to determine the abundance of PML-mRNA at different stages of DENV life cycle. We confirmed that there is a strong correlation between the infection progression and the upregulation of PML-mRNA level. However, when time course immunofluorescence studies were performed, the pattern of PML did not change during the early stages of infection, and only after the new progeny of DENV-2 was released, a reduction in PML-NBs staining was observed. Altogether these results strongly suggest that a viral protein might be responsible of the PML-NBs disruption. This phenomenon could be a consequence of these protein interactions, where PML could be sequestrated by a DENV protein. Several proteins have been reported to interact with nuclear components, including factors related to IFN response [<xref rid="pone.0125690.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125690.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Another speculation might be a competition for SUMOylation between a viral protein and PML, as it was described that PML-NBs assembly strictly depends on this post-translational modification [<xref rid="pone.0125690.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>Early studies indicated that many PML-NBs proteins, such as PML and Sp100, are IFN inducible [<xref rid="pone.0125690.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. IFN-I treatment of cells greatly increases the number, intensity and size of PML-NBs and thus, this contributes to an enhanced antiviral innate response of PML [<xref rid="pone.0125690.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125690.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In order to confirm that the increment in number and size of PML-NBs in neighboring cells was related to the IFN-I secretion, medium collected from infected cells was used to treat fresh A549 cell cultures. In these treated uninfected cells, a huge increment in size and number of PML-NBs was seen; confirming the presence of IFN-related soluble factors in the collected medium from DENV-2 infected A549 cells. Furthermore, the mRNA level of the central molecules of innate immune pathway was analyzed. The mRNAs corresponding to IL-6 and IFN-&#x003b2; were significantly up-regulated in DENV-2 infected A549 cell cultures, and this effect was not observed neither in non-replicating UV-inactivated DENV-2 infected A549 cell cultures nor in DENV-2 infected cells in the absence of IFN. Interestingly, the PML-mRNA expression level was significantly upregulated in all cell cultures, in comparison with non-infected cells. However, A549 DENV-2 infected cells presented a significant enhancement of PML-mRNA relative expression reaching an increase as high as 5000-fold.</p><p>These results confirmed that PML intrinsic antiviral mechanism is independent of IFN, however, it is noticeably enhanced in IFN producing cell lines (A549) in comparison to cell lines deficient for IFN production (Vero), showing the importance of PML also in the innate immune response. Thus, it seems that the constitutive expression of PML would allow for immediate antiviral activity of this molecule, an effect that is potentiated in neighboring cells upon upregulation through IFN produced by the infected cells, or it would indirectly participate in the IFN-mediated upregulation of known or yet unknown IFN-regulated proteins with antiviral activity.</p><p>In conclusion, several genome-wide RNAi screens have identified host enhancement or host restriction factors involved in the viral replication cycle of several members of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family including hepatitis C virus (HCV) [<xref rid="pone.0125690.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125690.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], West Nile virus (WNV) [<xref rid="pone.0125690.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], and Yellow fever virus (YFV) [<xref rid="pone.0125690.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. However, limited studies about human host restriction factors involved in DENV replication have been described [<xref rid="pone.0125690.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>The present study constitutes the first evidence that PML contributes to a cellular antiviral response and restricts DENV-2 replication in human A549 cells. The exact mechanism behind PML-mediated intracellular defense against DENV, as well as the strategy of virus evasion from this cellular defense requires further study. Furthermore, the evaluation of the antiviral properties of PML in other susceptible cell types more representative of the natural infection will improve the perspectives for a future therapeutic use as anti-DENV target. Moreover, the importance of PML antiviral activity for other viruses has been shown also in animal models. PML deficiency renders mice more susceptible to some viral infections [<xref rid="pone.0125690.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], resulting in an increased viral replication.
