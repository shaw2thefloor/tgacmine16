         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>The intrinsic antiviral defense is based on cellular restriction factors that are
            constitutively expressed and, thus, active even before a pathogen enters the cell.
            The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (NBs) are discrete nuclear foci that
            contain several cellular proteins involved in intrinsic antiviral responses against
            a number of viruses. Accumulating reports have shown the importance of PML as a DNA
            virus restriction factor and how these pathogens evade this antiviral activity. However,
            very little information is available regarding the antiviral role of PML against RNA
            viruses. Dengue virus (DENV) is an RNA emerging mosquito-borne human pathogen affecting
            millions of individuals each year by causing severe and potentially fatal syndromes.
            Since no licensed antiviral drug against DENV infection is currently available, it
            is of great importance to understand the factors mediating intrinsic immunity that
            may lead to the development of new pharmacological agents that can boost their potency
            and thereby lead to treatments for this viral disease. In the present study, we investigated
            the 
            <i>in vitro</i> antiviral role of PML in DENV-2 A549 infected cells.

         <p>The intrinsic antiviral resistance response, unlike cytokine-mediated response, involves

            and modification of over 90 cellular proteins. PML-NBs are sub-nuclear structures
            associated with the nuclear matrix, which have been implicated in numerous cellular
            processes including transcription, post-translational modifications, oncogenesis,
            innate immunity, and several antiviral responses [

         <p>PML-NBs have been shown to be an important intrinsic restriction factor and also contribute

            However, IFN-I treatment increases the number and size of PML-NBs and enhances its
            antiviral activity [

            cells. Since their discovery, PML-NBs have been investigated for their role in the
            virus-host cell interactions of DNA viruses that must replicate in the mammalian cell

            viruses. It has been demonstrated that fibroblasts derived from PML-/- mice are much
            more sensitive to some RNA viruses, such as the rhabdoviruses vesicular stomatitis
            and rabies virus, and the arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. These and
            other findings implicate PML in an intrinsic antiviral response of the cell that targets
            not only DNA but also RNA viruses [

            (TRIpartite Motif), but differ in their C-terminal region. The variability of the
            C-terminal part is important for the recruitment of specific interacting partners
            and for the specific function of each PML isoform [

            <h3>DENV-2 infection alters the intracellular localization and expression level of PML</h3>
            <p>More than 90 different proteins can associate with PML-NBs, either transiently or
               constitutively, but PML is the major structural component of PML-NBs, and their stability
               depends on PML presence. Several reports have revealed various strategies developed
               by viruses to interact with PML and, in consequence, to disrupt PML-NBs [

               </span>]. Thus, we next examined whether the integrity of PML-NBs was altered and the expression
               of PML was modified during DENV-2 infection. In order to achieve that, A549 cells
               were infected with DENV-2 and at 24 h p.i cells were fixed with methanol to detect
               E viral protein and observe intracellular PML-NBs localization. Double immunofluorescence
               studies showed a clear decrement in the number of PML-NBs in most DENV-2 infected
               cells. As can be seen in 
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0125690.g003">Fig 3A</span>, in some viral antigen positive cells, the typical punctuate nuclear staining pattern
               of PML-NBs was lost. This observation implies some degradation of PML-NBs during DENV-2
               infection. Moreover, confocal microscopy images showed that neighboring cells presented
               a weak viral protein signal along with a significantly distinct nuclear staining of
               PML-NBs, with increased number (15 ± 5 PML-NBs/nucleus) and size (0.7 ± 0.2 μm diameter)

            <h3>PML anti-DENV-2 activity is enhanced after IFN pathway activation</h3>
            <p>It is known that IFN-I enhances the intrinsic antiviral activity of PML. Thus, the
               increment in number and size of PML-NBs in neighboring infected cells, seen in Figs

               In order to assess this possibility, conditioned medium was collected from A549 DENV-2
               infected cells and used to treat fresh A549 cells. As positive control, other A549
               cell cultures were treated with IFN-I. As it can be seen in 
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0125690.g006">Fig 6A</span>, both treatments led to a bigger size and number of PML-NBs in these cell cultures.
               To gain more insight about this PML-innate immunity related antiviral response, the
               level of mRNAs of IFN pathway associated genes (TLR3, RIG-I, TRAF6, IFN-β, IL-6 and
               PML) was quantified in the DENV-2 infected A549 cell cultures at 24 h p.i. As control,
               UV-inactivated DENV-2 was used for infection, and in parallel, DENV-2 infected A549
               cells were treated with an inhibitor of the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators
               of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway to restrict IFN-I signaling. Also Vero cells,
               a monkey kidney epithelial cell line deficient for IFN production, were infected with
               DENV-2. In all cases, the same panel of mRNAs IFN pathway related genes was analyzed.

               Next, we also included the analysis of expression of the adapter molecule TRAF-6 and
               two important cytokines IL-6 and IFN-β. While TRAF-6 expression was not altered at
               this time point of infection, the level of mRNAs corresponding to IL-6 and IFN-β were
               significantly upregulated in DENV-2 infected A549 cell cultures. It is worth to note
               that these effects were not observed in non-replicating UV-inactivated DENV-2 infected
               A549 cell cultures. This response is expected since the IFN potent antiviral response
               is initiated immediately after the pathogens enter into the cell and begin to replicate.
               Moreover, the upregulation of IFN pathway related genes was not observed neither in
               DENV-2 infected A549 cells treated with a JAK-I inhibitor nor in DENV-2 infected Vero
               cells, confirming that the enhancement was a specific response to the activation of
               the IFN pathway.

            <p>On the other hand, it was observed that PML-mRNA expression level was significantly
               upregulated in all cell cultures, in comparison with non-infected ones. This observation
               is in accordance with the constitutive overexpression of PML after virus entry. However,
               DENV-2 infected A549 cells presented a significant enhancement of PML-mRNA relative
               expression at 24 h p.i., reaching an increase as high as 5000 ± 600 fold that can
               be explained by the INF-I stimulation in these cell cultures (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0125690.g006">Fig 6B</span>).
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, immunoflourescence images showed that in DENV-2 infected Vero cells PML-NBs
               were also disrupted, but neighboring cells did not present an enhanced PML-NBs pattern.
               However these cultures showed bigger size and number of PML-NBs after IFN-I treatment
               (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0125690.g006">Fig 6C</span>). Altogether these results confirmed the importance of IFN-I to reinforce the intrinsic
               antiviral activity of PML against DENV-2.

         <p>Intrinsic antiviral resistance is a cellular antiviral defense that involves diverse
            proteins and mechanisms, depending on the particular virus. Most of the characterized
            restriction factors have been studied in the context of HIV-1 life cycle and have
            been described as possessing potent antiretroviral activity 
            <i>in vitro</i> and 
            <i>in vivo</i> [

            </span>]. In the last years, it was described that PML is implicated in the intrinsic antiviral
            immunity against different viruses in the absence of IFN-I, however its activity is
            enhanced by this molecule [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0125690.ref041">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>]. In the present study, we have explored the possible role of PML as an intrinsic
            restriction factor against DENV-2.
         </p>
         <p>First, we evaluated the impact of PML silencing and overexpression on DENV-2 replication.
            The silencing of all PML isoforms caused about 0.76 log increment in DENV-2 titre,
            in comparison with virus production obtained when small non-interfering RNAs were
            used for transfection. On the other hand, the PMLIV isoform overexpression reduced
            significantly the extracellular DENV-2 production. These results were in accordance
            with the viral antigen expression observed by immunofluorescence. The PML silencing
            rendered A549 cell cultures more susceptible to virus propagation and the overexpression
            of PMLIV highly inhibited the viral antigen expression in infected cells. It is worth
            to mention that these results were not influenced by the level of apoptosis in these
            cell cultures.
         </p>
         <p>Moreover, we analyzed the intracellular localization of PML-NBs during DENV-2 replication.
            Confocal microscopy images showed that the typical punctuate nuclear staining pattern
            of PML-NBs was lost during DENV-2 infection. It remains unclear if the disruption
            of PML-NBs during DENV-2 infection was a consequence of the interaction between a
            viral component and this restriction factor, as a viral counterpart action against
            this antiviral cellular activity. Furthermore, confocal images showed a weak viral
            protein signal in neighboring cells, which also displayed increased number and size
            of PML-NBs.
         </p>
         <p>The next step was to determine the abundance of PML-mRNA at different stages of DENV
            life cycle. We confirmed that there is a strong correlation between the infection
            progression and the upregulation of PML-mRNA level. However, when time course immunofluorescence
            studies were performed, the pattern of PML did not change during the early stages
            of infection, and only after the new progeny of DENV-2 was released, a reduction in
            PML-NBs staining was observed. Altogether these results strongly suggest that a viral
            protein might be responsible of the PML-NBs disruption. This phenomenon could be a
            consequence of these protein interactions, where PML could be sequestrated by a DENV
            protein. Several proteins have been reported to interact with nuclear components,
            including factors related to IFN response [

            </span>]. Another speculation might be a competition for SUMOylation between a viral protein
            and PML, as it was described that PML-NBs assembly strictly depends on this post-translational
            modification [

            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>Early studies indicated that many PML-NBs proteins, such as PML and Sp100, are IFN
            inducible [

            </span>]. IFN-I treatment of cells greatly increases the number, intensity and size of PML-NBs
            and thus, this contributes to an enhanced antiviral innate response of PML [

               </sup>
            </span>]. In order to confirm that the increment in number and size of PML-NBs in neighboring
            cells was related to the IFN-I secretion, medium collected from infected cells was
            used to treat fresh A549 cell cultures. In these treated uninfected cells, a huge
            increment in size and number of PML-NBs was seen; confirming the presence of IFN-related
            soluble factors in the collected medium from DENV-2 infected A549 cells. Furthermore,
            the mRNA level of the central molecules of innate immune pathway was analyzed. The
            mRNAs corresponding to IL-6 and IFN-β were significantly up-regulated in DENV-2 infected
            A549 cell cultures, and this effect was not observed neither in non-replicating UV-inactivated
            DENV-2 infected A549 cell cultures nor in DENV-2 infected cells in the absence of
            IFN. Interestingly, the PML-mRNA expression level was significantly upregulated in
            all cell cultures, in comparison with non-infected cells. However, A549 DENV-2 infected
            cells presented a significant enhancement of PML-mRNA relative expression reaching
            an increase as high as 5000-fold.
         </p>
         <p>These results confirmed that PML intrinsic antiviral mechanism is independent of IFN,
            however, it is noticeably enhanced in IFN producing cell lines (A549) in comparison
            to cell lines deficient for IFN production (Vero), showing the importance of PML also
            in the innate immune response. Thus, it seems that the constitutive expression of
            PML would allow for immediate antiviral activity of this molecule, an effect that
            is potentiated in neighboring cells upon upregulation through IFN produced by the
            infected cells, or it would indirectly participate in the IFN-mediated upregulation
            of known or yet unknown IFN-regulated proteins with antiviral activity.

         <p>The present study constitutes the first evidence that PML contributes to a cellular
            antiviral response and restricts DENV-2 replication in human A549 cells. The exact
            mechanism behind PML-mediated intracellular defense against DENV, as well as the strategy
            of virus evasion from this cellular defense requires further study. Furthermore, the
            evaluation of the antiviral properties of PML in other susceptible cell types more
            representative of the natural infection will improve the perspectives for a future
            therapeutic use as anti-DENV target. Moreover, the importance of PML antiviral activity
            for other viruses has been shown also in animal models. PML deficiency renders mice
            more susceptible to some viral infections [

            </span>], resulting in an increased viral replication. Despite that our 
            <i>in vitro</i> results are in accordance with the findings of these groups, it would be necessary
            to demonstrate in future studies the relevance of PMLIV anti-DENV activity 
            <i>in vivo</i>. It would be interesting to investigate if the kinetics of this host restriction
            factor at different stages of human DENV infection could be used as a biomarker in
            disease progression or in the assessment of the severity of dengue disease.
