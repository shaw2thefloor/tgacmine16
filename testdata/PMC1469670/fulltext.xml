During 1992 to 1994, immunological responses and related variables were measured in prefledgling chicks at colonies distributed across a broad gradient of organochlorine contamination (primarily polychlorinated biphenyls), which was measured in eggs. The phytohemagglutinin skin test was used to assess T-lymphocyte function. In both species, there was a strong exposure-response relationship between organochlorines and suppressed T-cell-mediated immunity. Suppression was most severe (30-45%) in colonies in Lake Ontario (1992) and Saginaw Bay (1992-1994) for both species and in western Lake Erie (1992) for herring gulls. Both species exhibited biologically significant differences among sites in anti-sheep red blood cells antibody titers, but consistent exposure-response relationships with organochlorines were not observed. In Caspian terns and, to a lesser degree, in herring gulls, there was an exposure-response relationship between organochlorines and reduced plasma retinol (vitamin A). In 1992, altered White blood cell numbers were associated with elevated organochlorine concentrations in Caspian terns but not herring gulls. The immunological and hematological biomarkers used in this study revealed contaminant-associated health effects in wild birds. An epidemiological analysis strongly supported the hypothesis that suppression of T-cell-mediated immunity was associated with high perinatal exposure to persistent organochlorine contaminants.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="envhper00347-0136.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="829" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00347-0137.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="830" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00347-0138.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="831" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00347-0139.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="832" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00347-0140.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="833" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00347-0141.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="834" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00347-0142.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="835" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00347-0143.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="836" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00347-0144.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="837" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00347-0145.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="838" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00347-0146.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="839" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00347-0147.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="840" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00347-0148.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="841" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00347-0149.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="842" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
