         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>The objectives of study were to determine whether contaminant-associated immunosuppression
            occurs in prefledgling herring gulls and Caspian terns from the Great Lakes and to
            evaluate immunological biomarkers for monitoring health effects in wild birds. During
            1992 to 1994, immunological responses and related variables were measured in prefledgling
            chicks at colonies distributed across a broad gradient of organochlorine contamination
            (primarily polychlorinated biphenyls), which was measured in eggs. The phytohemagglutinin
            skin test was used to assess T-lymphocyte function. In both species, there was a strong
            exposure-response relationship between organochlorines and suppressed T-cell-mediated
            immunity. Suppression was most severe (30-45%) in colonies in Lake Ontario (1992)
            and Saginaw Bay (1992-1994) for both species and in western Lake Erie (1992) for herring
            gulls. Both species exhibited biologically significant differences among sites in
            anti-sheep red blood cells antibody titers, but consistent exposure-response relationships
            with organochlorines were not observed. In Caspian terns and, to a lesser degree,
            in herring gulls, there was an exposure-response relationship between organochlorines
            and reduced plasma retinol (vitamin A). In 1992, altered White blood cell numbers
            were associated with elevated organochlorine concentrations in Caspian terns but not
            herring gulls. The immunological and hematological biomarkers used in this study revealed
            contaminant-associated health effects in wild birds. An epidemiological analysis strongly
            supported the hypothesis that suppression of T-cell-mediated immunity was associated
            with high perinatal exposure to persistent organochlorine contaminants.
