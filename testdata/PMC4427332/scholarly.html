            <p>The vaccines were generally well-tolerated, and did not cause serious adverse events.
               The response rate, by IFN-γ ELISPOT, was greater when Ad35-GRIN was the priming vaccine
               and in the co-administration groups. F4/AS01 induced CD4+ T-cells expressing primarily
               CD40L and IL2 +/- TNF-α, while Ad35-GRIN induced predominantly CD8+ T-cells expressing
               IFN-γ +/- IL2 or TNF-α. Viral inhibition was induced after Ad35-GRIN vaccination,
               regardless of the regimen. Strong F4-specific antibody responses were induced. Immune
               responses persisted at least a year after the last vaccination. The complementary
               response profiles, characteristic of each vaccine, were both expressed after co-administration.

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Although an effective prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine is likely to require the induction
            of broad and potent Env-specific antibody responses, CD8+ T lymphocyte responses that
            control HIV replication and CD4+ T lymphocytes that help generate and maintain HIV-specific
            cellular and humoral responses may also be necessary. Many T-cell based vaccines assessed
            in humans induce responses that are skewed to either CD4+ or CD8+ T-cell responses
            [

            </span>]. Cellular immune responses are critical in containing viral load; CD8 T cells generated
            within days of HIV infection result in lowering viral loads and slowing the rate of
            CD4+ T-cell decline. In long-term non-progressors, CD8+ T cells with multiple functions
            appear to control viral load for extended periods of time [

            depletion of T cells in SIV-infected macaques leads to uncontrolled viremia [

            would be combined with an HIV envelope (Env) immunogen to induce neutralizing and/or
            non-neutralizing functional antibodies.

            has an acceptable safety and reactogenicity profile and induces robust CD4+ T-cell

            safety and immunogenicity was evaluated in participants without preexisting Ad35 immunity.
            We hypothesized that the combination—either sequential prime boosts or co-administration
            of F4/AS01 and Ad35-GRIN—might induce complementary HIV-1 specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell
            responses. We also evaluated if the order of administration (i.e. Ad35-GRIN both as
            a prime for F4/AS01 and as a boost) influenced the quality of T cell response, as
            well as the quantity of antibodies produced. This paper summarizes the evaluation
            of several regimens, with a view to constructing the ideal future HIV vaccine candidate,
            combining T- and B-cell immunogens that will induce optimal responses in both arms
            of the immune response.

               of contraception, and testing negative for Ad35-specific neutralizing antibodies (EC90
               titer &lt;16). Women were not pregnant and not lactating. Volunteers with chronic medical
               disease, including hepatitis B or C infection, were excluded. Volunteer comprehension
               of the study was ascertained using an assessment of understanding tool with true/false
               questions. Volunteers were screened up to 42 days before vaccination (up to 90 days
               for Ad35 neutralizing antibody), and followed for 64 weeks post first administration.
               Allocation schedules were computer generated. Investigators, volunteers, laboratory
               personnel and clinical monitors were blind to treatment assignments. Ongoing HIV risk
               assessments and prevention counseling were offered to volunteers during the trial.
               The study was a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 1
               trial of heterologous prime-boost or co-administration 3-dose regimens (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0125954.g001">Fig 1</span>). Enrolled volunteers were randomized to one of the 4 regimens (groups A, B, C, or
               D), with approximately 28 vaccine and 7 placebo recipients per group, receiving 0.5
               mL (F4/AS01) and/or 1.0 mL (Ad35-GRIN) injections of vaccine or placebo in the deltoid
               muscle of the non-dominant arm. Vaccinations were given at baseline, month 1 or month
               3, and month 4. In the co-administration group (D), the F4/AS01 and Ad35-GRIN vaccines
               or placebos were administered into the same deltoid muscle, approximately 2–4 cm apart.

               <h3>Study Vaccines</h3>
               <p>The F4/AS01 HIV candidate vaccine consists of 10 μg of F4, a lyophilized recombinant
                  fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli and comprising 4 HIV-1 clade B antigens:
                  p24 (BH10), RT (reverse transcriptase) (HXB2) mutated to remove the RT polymerase
                  activity, Nef (Bru-Lai), and p17 (BH10). The vaccine antigen was prepared as a lyophilized
                  pellet containing F4 in sucrose, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, arginine, polysorbate
                  80, and sodium sulfite in phosphate buffer. The F4 vaccine was manufactured according
                  to the principles of Good Manufacturing by Practices (GMP) by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals,
                  Rixensart, Belgium. The AS01
                  <sub>B</sub> adjuvant is an Adjuvant System containing 50 μg 3-
                  <i>O</i>-desacyl-4’-monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), 50 μg QS-21 (

                  <sub>E</sub> contained half the quantity of immunostimulants of AS01
                  <sub>B</sub>. F4 was reconstituted in the AS01 liquid adjuvant immediately prior to vaccination
                  and administered as 0.5mL containing 10 μg of F4/AS01 by intramuscular injection.
               </p>
               <p>The Ad35-GRIN is a recombinant replication-defective adenovirus serotype 35 containing
                  HIV -1 subtype A gag, RT, integrase, and nef genes (abbreviated as GRIN). The genes
                  were designed as a fusion product, and codon optimized for human cell expression and
                  translation. Mutations were introduced into the sequence to abrogate functional activity.
                  Ad35-GRIN vaccine was produced in HER96 cells by Transgene (Strasbourg, France) according
                  to the principles of GMP. The vaccine was prepared in formulation buffer composed
                  of Tris 10 mM pH 8.5, Sucrose 342.3 g/L, 1mM MgCl
                  <sub>2</sub>, Tween80 54 mg/L and 150mm NaCl in water for injection and administered as 1.0mL

            <h3>Safety Assessments</h3>
            <p>Safety and tolerability were assessed clinically and by routine laboratory tests.
               Volunteers recorded local and systemic reactogenicity on memory cards for 14 days
               post-vaccination, which were reviewed by clinicians. Data on spontaneously reported
               adverse events were collected during the vaccination period. Laboratory safety assessments,
               including full blood count and chemistries, were performed on the day of vaccination,
               7 and 28 days after each vaccination, at week 36 and at end of study. Urinalysis was
               performed on the day of vaccination, 14 days after each vaccination and at end of
               study. Women were not vaccinated unless the urine pregnancy test was negative prior
               to each vaccination. Safety testing was done at the respective study center laboratories.
               All safety data were graded according to the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the
               Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events (DAIDS AE Grading Table), Version 1.0,
               December 2004. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were defined in accordance with International
               Conference on Harmonization—Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) guidelines. HIV-1/2 EIAs
               (Vironostika HIV Uni-Form II Ag/Ab, Bio Merieux) were performed at weeks 4 or 12,
               16, 20, 36, 48, and 64. Plasma from volunteers with reactive results was tested for
               HIV infection using the Abbott real time PCR kit (Abbott Molecular).

                  antibody concentrations (GMCs) for each individual antigen and the F4 fusion protein

                  the exact method for binomial variables. The 95% CIs for GMCs were calculated by taking
                  the anti-log of the 95% CI of the mean log10-transformed antibody values. For each
                  individual F4 antigen and the fusion protein, antibody concentrations below the cut-off

               of reactogenicity and specific adverse events in the vaccine and placebo groups were
               compared by Fisher’s exact test. Immunogenicity results were summarized within each

               percentages (with 95% CI) for categorical variables. The study was initially powered
               to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the immune response induced by F4/AS01E compared
               to F4/AS01B. The criterion used was the following: the upper limit of the 95% CI for

            <h3>Protocol Deviations</h3>
            <p>There were 190 protocol deviations in this study, mostly minor deviations involving
               protocol-specified study visit windows or schedule compliance or involving isolated
               inability to obtain complete collections of biological specimens (i.e., shortage of
               blood volume due to poor venous access). One volunteer was incorrectly administered
               vaccine and was analyzed with the vaccine group. One enrolled volunteer did not meet
               the eligibility requirements and was discontinued after the first vaccination. PBMCs
               were not collected at one of the clinical centers at Day 42. A symptom-directed physical
               exam was conducted at one of the clinical centers at the final visit, instead of protocol
               specified general physical exam, but general exams were performed once the deviation
               was identified. No protocol deviations were recorded as resulting in adverse events.
               The interpretation of the data presented here is not affected by the protocol deviations.

            <h3>Safety and Tolerability</h3>
            <p>No vaccine-related serious adverse events occurred in any group (95% CI, 0%- 3%).
               All placebo recipients were grouped together for analysis. Overall, the vaccines were
               well tolerated in all groups. There were no statistically significant differences
               in moderate or worse local or systemic reactogenicity events among treatment and placebo
               groups. Injection site reactions were common after both F4/AS01 and Ad35-GRIN (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0125954.g003">Fig 3</span>). Pain and tenderness were the most common local reactions. The majority were mild
               or moderate. Five volunteers had severe (Grade 3) pain and/or tenderness; all events
               were self-limited and resolved in 1–5 days (
               <span ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0125954.s007">S1 Text</span>). Systemic reactogenicity was also common in all groups, including the placebo group.
               Chills, headache, malaise, fatigue, myalgia and arthralgia were the most common systemic
               events. Most were mild or moderate. Nineteen volunteers had severe (grade 3) reactions:
               9 after F4/AS01, 1 after Ad35-GRIN, 6 after co-administration, one after Ad35-GRIN
               and again after F4/AS01, and 2 among placebo recipients (Supplementary data). All
               events were transient and resolved spontaneously. There were no vaccine-related severe
               or very severe clinical adverse events or laboratory abnormalities. There was no evidence
               of vaccine-induced seropositivity as measured by the 4th generation HIV Ag/Ab ELISA.
               At entry into a long-term follow up study, two rapid HIV tests were used (Alere Determine
               HIV 1/2 and Trinity Uni-Gold). Two vaccine recipients, one in Group A and one in Group
               C had reactive Alere Determine results but no evidence of HIV infection by RNA PCR.

            <p>HIV infection occurred in two vaccine recipients who received the co-administered
               vaccines (Group D), after receiving all vaccinations. One volunteer reported a new

                  In contrast, in group C after the initial vaccination with Ad35-GRIN, the majority
                  of CD4+ T-cells were multifunctional at M1 (
                  <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0125954.g008">Fig 8B</span>). These cells expressed IFN-γ and IL-2, alone or in combination, and about 1/3 of
                  the cells expressed three cytokines (data not shown). Although the magnitude of the
                  response was amplified after two booster doses of F4/AS01 the multifunctional profile
                  was not modified at M5 (
                  <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0125954.g008">Fig 8A and 8B</span>). In the co-administration group (Group D), high levels of multifunctional CD4+ T-cells
                  were readily induced after two doses (
                  <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0125954.g008">Fig 8A and 8B</span>). In all groups over all time points, GRIN-specific CD8+ T-cells expressed mainly
                  one cytokine and to a lesser extent 2 cytokines (
                  <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0125954.g008">Fig 8C</span>). These cells expressed IFN-γ alone or in combination with IL-2 or TNF-α (data not
                  shown). As the magnitude of F4-specific CD8+ T cells was near to baseline, the functional
                  profile is not shown. Whatever the groups, the respective T cell functional profiles
                  observed at M5 were maintained up to M16.

                  VIA was detected in 2/8 volunteers (25%) and after the Ad35-GRIN boost, VIA activity
                  was detected in 6/8 (75%) of volunteers respectively. In Group C, when Ad35-GRIN was
                  administered as a prime followed by two F4/AS01 at 3 and 4 months, VIA activity was
                  detected in 6/7 (86%) and 4/7 (57%) of individuals respectively. In Group D, when
                  F4/AS01 and Ad35-GRIN were co-administered, VIA was detected in 5/8 (63%) after the

                  Group B compared to Group C (p = 0.003) and Group D (p = 0.06). There was a similar
                  breadth of VIA activity assessed by the number of viruses inhibited per volunteer
                  with an average of 1.9, 3.1 and 1.8 viruses respectively across groups B-D (data not

            or worse adverse events among treatment and placebo groups. There was no evidence
            of vaccine-induced seropositivity as measured by 4th generation HIV Ag/Ab ELISA at
            trial completion or rapid HIV test kits in common use throughout Africa. At entry
            into a long-term follow up study, two rapid HIV tests were used (Alere Determine HIV
            1/2 and Trinity Uni-Gold). Two vaccine recipients, one in Group A and one in Group
            C, had reactive results by Determine HIV test but no evidence of HIV infection by
            RNA PCR.

         <p>Adjuvanted F4/AS01 and Ad35-GRIN regimens induced high ELISPOT response rates, balanced
            CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses which persisted over time, and high titers of F4 binding
            antibodies. The vaccine regimens assessed in this trial were designed to induce multifunctional
            CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to deal with viral escape and inhibit viral activity
            across clades. The regimens tested in this trial appeared to induce responses that

         <p>Multifunctional T-cell responses are present in HIV controllers, and such responses
            may be important for immune control of HIV. Balanced CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses
            were elicited by these vaccines, with profiles differing across regimens. F4/AS01
            induced high levels of F4-specific CD4+ T-cells with cross-reactivity against Clade
            A and Ad35-GRIN induced CD4+ T-cells against Clade A with weak cross-reactivity against
            Clade B. Ad35-GRIN administered once in each of Groups A-C induced high levels of
            GRIN-specific CD8+ T-cells; a higher magnitude of CD8+ responses was maintained up
            to one year after three co-administrations in group D. The immune marker, CD40L is

            In group C, the majority of CD4+ T-cells induced by one dose of Ad35-GRIN were multifunctional.
            In the co-administration group (Group D), high levels of multifunctional CD4+ T-cell
            responses were induced after 2 doses, and after a third dose were similar. Group D

            the other groups which may have influenced persistence and polyfunctionality of CD4+
            and CD8+ immune responses in this group. In all groups, the CD4+ T-cell response was
            maintained for at least one year after the last vaccination.

         <p>The response rates as detected by flow cytometry were generally greater than response
            rates detected by ELISPOT, the main reason for this is because the ELISPOT is based
            on IFN-γ production only whereas ICS detects responses to IFN-γ, Il-2 and TNF-α. Responses
            to F4/AS01 induce CD4+ T cells expressing mainly IL-2 and Ad35 induces polyfunctional
            CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells that express mainly IFN-γ. Thus differences between
            ELISPOT and ICS are more marked at 1M and 1.5M post F4/AS01B prime particularly for
            CD4-specific responses. When Ad35-GRIN is used as a prime or in the co-administration
            group D, the profile is more polyfunctional and therefore the proportion of T-cells
            (including CD4 and CD8) expressing IFN-γ increases and the difference in percent responses
            as detected by ICS and ELISPOT is less distinct.

            Ads are not clear, the Ad35 neutralizing assay may not be sensitive enough to detect
            very low titers or the assay does not pick up all neutralizing antibody epitopes.
            Higher vaccine doses of Ad35 or Chimp Ad administered to humans increases the vaccine
            take and titer in some volunteers. However, some volunteers still did not have a response
            to the vector but did have a response to the insert which may suggest HLA or other
            immune response associated with Ad vector responses [

         <p>It would have been valuable to compare the impressive systemic T cell responses with
            those of mucosal cells such as α4γ7+ expressing CD4+ T cells. However, this study
            did not obtain biopsy samples hence did not evaluate T cell subsets that are targeted
            by the HIV virus. Future studies with these vaccines should evaluate target T cell
            subsets in humans as described recently [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0125954.ref010">

            </span>]. Another limitation of this study is that the total volume of blood was limited
            so the primary immunogenicity assays were prioritized hence no Adenovirus peptide
            pool was included in the functional screens.
         </p>
         <p>Placebo recipients were included to provide an appropriate control group for evaluation
            of vaccine safety and tolerability, particularly local and systemic reactogenicity
            [

            </span>]. We felt this was particularly important for these prime boost regimens including
            an adjuvant, as adjuvants may have significant reactogenicity profiles. This trial
            was designed to evaluate immunogenicity responses in people without Ad35 pre-existing
            immunity, therefore it is difficult to comment on the issue of potential enhancement
            due to pre-existing Ad35 immunity. In subsequent trials (unpublished data) we have
            evaluated the Ad35-GRIN and other Ad35 vaccines in people with and without Ad35 pre-existing
            immunity.
         </p>
         <p>Overall the combination of adjuvanted F4 and Ad35 GRIN induced balanced CD4+ and CD8+
            T-cell responses with multifunctional profiles which persisted over time and high
            titers of F4 binding antibodies. The vaccine regimens assessed in this trial were
            designed to induce multifunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to deal with viral
            escape and inhibit viral activity across clades. Next generation immunogens may further
            improve the quality and breadth of T-cell responses across clades and should be incorporated
            into regimens such as those assessed in this trial: using low-seroprevalent adenoviral
            vectors and adjuvanted proteins in co-administration, ideally combined with Env immunogens
            with the capacity to induce neutralizing and/or non-neutralizing antibodies.
