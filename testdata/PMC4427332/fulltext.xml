Many T-cell based vaccines assessed in humans induce responses that are skewed to either CD4+ or CD8+ T-cell responses [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Cellular immune responses are critical in containing viral load; CD8 T cells generated within days of HIV infection result in lowering viral loads and slowing the rate of CD4+ T-cell decline. In long-term non-progressors, CD8+ T cells with multiple functions appear to control viral load for extended periods of time [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The important role of T cells in control of SIV infection has been demonstrated in multiple non-human primate studies and confirms what has been seen in humans, moreover depletion of T cells in SIV-infected macaques leads to uncontrolled viremia [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Finally, potent CD8+ T cell responses induced by vaccination of macaques have led to dramatic reduction of SIV to undetectable levels in infected animals [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In future development, a regimen capable of inducing CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses would be combined with an HIV envelope (Env) immunogen to induce neutralizing and/or non-neutralizing functional antibodies.</p><p>Phase 1 studies in Europe and the US, respectively, suggest that the F4 HIV vaccine (clade B p24, RT, Nef, p17 fusion protein) formulated with the AS01 adjuvant system has an acceptable safety and reactogenicity profile and induces robust CD4+ T-cell response and antibody responses in HIV-1-uninfected volunteers and HIV-1-infected patients [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125954.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and that the Ad35-GRIN vaccine (expressing clade A Gag, RT, Int and Nef) is safe and induces a robust CD8+ T-cell response [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Adenoviral vectors can effectively transduce host cells and induce high magnitude CD8+ T cell responses in a high proportion of vaccinees, without production of infectious adenovirus or integration into the host genome [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Several observations have shown that Adenoviral vectors are a good prime for T-cell response but the mechanism is not yet understood [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125954.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Because immunity to Ad35 varies among populations and could affect vaccine responses, safety and immunogenicity was evaluated in participants without preexisting Ad35 immunity. We hypothesized that the combination&#x02014;either sequential prime boosts or co-administration of F4/AS01 and Ad35-GRIN&#x02014;might induce complementary HIV-1 specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. We also evaluated if the order of administration (i.e. Ad35-GRIN both as a prime for F4/AS01 and as a boost) influenced the quality of T cell response, as well as the quantity of antibodies produced. This paper summarizes the evaluation of several regimens, with a view to constructing the ideal future HIV vaccine candidate, combining T- and B-cell immunogens that will induce optimal responses in both arms of the immune response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Ethics and regulatory approval</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the ethics committees of Kenyatta National Hospital, University of Nairobi, Uganda Virus Research Institute, University of Zambia and Emory University, and reviewed by the responsible regulatory authorities in each country.

The first screening was on 10 Jan 2011, the first enrolment was on 28 Feb 2011, the last enrolment was 13 Aug 2011, and the last follow-up was on 28 Feb 2013. Volunteers were healthy, aged 18&#x02013;40 years, at lower risk for HIV infection with confirmed negative serology for HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection, willing to use an effective method of contraception, and testing negative for Ad35-specific neutralizing antibodies (EC90 titer &#x0003c;16). Women were not pregnant and not lactating. Volunteers with chronic medical disease, including hepatitis B or C infection, were excluded. Volunteer comprehension of the study was ascertained using an assessment of understanding tool with true/false questions. Volunteers were screened up to 42 days before vaccination (up to 90 days for Ad35 neutralizing antibody), and followed for 64 weeks post first administration. Allocation schedules were computer generated. Investigators, volunteers, laboratory personnel and clinical monitors were blind to treatment assignments. Ongoing HIV risk assessments and prevention counseling were offered to volunteers during the trial. The study was a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 1 trial of heterologous prime-boost or co-administration 3-dose regimens (<xref rid="pone.0125954.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).

The vaccine antigen was prepared as a lyophilized pellet containing F4 in sucrose, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, arginine, polysorbate 80, and sodium sulfite in phosphate buffer. The F4 vaccine was manufactured according to the principles of Good Manufacturing by Practices (GMP) by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium. The AS01<sub>B</sub> adjuvant is an Adjuvant System containing 50 &#x003bc;g 3-<italic>O</italic>-desacyl-4&#x02019;-monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), 50 &#x003bc;g QS-21 (<italic>Quillaja saponaria</italic> Molina, fraction 21; Antigenics Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Agenus Inc., Lexington MA, USA) and liposomes. AS01<sub>E</sub> contained half the quantity of immunostimulants of AS01<sub>B</sub>.

Volunteers recorded local and systemic reactogenicity on memory cards for 14 days post-vaccination, which were reviewed by clinicians. Data on spontaneously reported adverse events were collected during the vaccination period. Laboratory safety assessments, including full blood count and chemistries, were performed on the day of vaccination, 7 and 28 days after each vaccination, at week 36 and at end of study. Urinalysis was performed on the day of vaccination, 14 days after each vaccination and at end of study. Women were not vaccinated unless the urine pregnancy test was negative prior to each vaccination. Safety testing was done at the respective study center laboratories. All safety data were graded according to the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events (DAIDS AE Grading Table), Version 1.0, December 2004. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were defined in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization&#x02014;Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) guidelines. HIV-1/2 EIAs (Vironostika HIV Uni-Form II Ag/Ab, Bio Merieux) were performed at weeks 4 or 12, 16, 20, 36, 48, and 64. Plasma from volunteers with reactive results was tested for HIV infection using the Abbott real time PCR kit (Abbott Molecular).</p><p>During the preclinical assessment of F4/AS01<sc><sub>B</sub></sc>, while tested together with a DNA based vaccine with or without Imiquimod application, lens opacities were noted in a minipig model, however the relationship to F4/AS01<sub>B</sub> vaccination was not clear. No lens opacities were observed in a repeated toxicological study in rabbits. Despite a weak biological plausibility, the inconclusive nature of this preclinical observation led to further ophthalmological evaluations in all subsequent clinical trials investigating F4/AS01<sc><sub>B</sub></sc>, alone or in combination with other vaccine components. In the present study ophthalmologic examination with slit-lamp was performed at baseline and at the end of the study at two of the four study centers (48% of volunteers).</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Immunogenicity Assessments</title><p>All immunogenicity assays were performed in a blinded fashion under Good Clinical Laboratory Practices (GCLP) [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125954.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

A viability marker (LIVE/DEAD, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) and CD3 marker were added to the staining panel. The same vaccine insert-matched peptides that were used in the ELISPOT assay were used for ICS stimulation. CMV-pp65 peptide pool was used as quality control. HIV-1-specific T-cell responses were expressed as the frequency of total CD4+ T-cells co-expressing CD40L (denoted as CD40L+ CD4+ T cells) and at least one cytokine or total CD8+ T-cells expressing at least one cytokine (IL-2, TNF-&#x003b1; or IFN-&#x003b3;), the cytokine co-expression profile and the percentage of responders to F4, GRIN and individual vaccine components. If cytokine secretion was undetectable at pre-vaccination, then a subject was considered a responder if the proportion of CD40L+CD4+ T-cells or CD8+ T-cells expressing at least one cytokine was &#x02265; the assay cut-off. The cut-off was based on the 95th percentile of all volunteers at pre-vaccination (rounded to the next 0.01&#x02014;with a min 0.03%). In subjects with detectable cytokine secretion at pre-vaccination, response was defined as a greater than 2-fold increase in CD40L+CD4+ T-cells or CD8+ T cells expressing at least one cytokine from baseline. Background values (culture with no peptides) were subtracted from HIV-1 specific values. For the ICS, the F4- and GRIN-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses were estimated from the sum of the specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell frequencies in response to each individual antigen.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Viral inhibition assay (VIA)</title><p>A VIA assay qualified for use in vaccine trials as described previously was used [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. VIA activity was assessed only in Groups B-D at three (B and C) or 4 timepoints (D). Briefly, antibody-expanded pre-vaccination CD4+ T cells were infected with a panel of HIV-viruses and cultured with pre- and post-vaccination antibody-expanded CD8+ T cells. The following HIV-1 isolates were used along with the subtype and Genbank accession numbers where known in parenthesis; IIIB (K03455, subtype B), ELI (K03454, subtype A/D), U455 (M62320, subtype A), 97ZA012 (AF286227, subtype C), CH77 (JN944909, subtype B), CH106 (JN944897, subtype B), 247FV2 (subtype C, generously donated by George Shaw, University of Birmingham, Alabama) and CBL-4 (formerly RUT, subtype D).

HIV-1 CBL-4 (provided by Dr Paul Clapham and Professor Robin Weiss) and HIV-1 U455 (provided by Dr R Downing) were obtained from the Centre for AIDS Reagents, National Institutes of Biological Standards and Control, UK). CD8+ T-cell-mediated inhibition was expressed as the log<sub>10</sub> reduction in p24 content of CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell co-cultures, compared with infected CD4+ T cells alone. The threshold used for positive inhibition was determined from previous validation studies as reduction in measurable p24 production of &#x0003e;1.5 logs, the pre-vaccination response for the same virus must be negative (i.e., not cross-reactive) and the difference between the post-vaccination and pre-vaccination response should be &#x02265;0.6 log<sub>10</sub> inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Humoral Immune Response to vaccine F4 antigens (ELISA)</title><p>Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody titers to F4, p17, p24, RT and Nef were analyzed using standard in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].

For the antibody response to F4 antigens (ELISA), seropositivity rates and geometric mean antibody concentrations (GMCs) for each individual antigen and the F4 fusion protein were calculated with 95% CIs. For seropositivity rates, 95% CIs were computed using the exact method for binomial variables. The 95% CIs for GMCs were calculated by taking the anti-log of the 95% CI of the mean log10-transformed antibody values.

In group C at M1, one vaccination with Ad35-GRIN induced fewer CD4+ T-cells and about half of the magnitude compared to immunization with two doses of F4/AS01 in groups A or B. For group D after the first co-administration at M1, CD4+ T cell responses were 91 and 77% respectively to F4 and GRIN peptides, and after the second co-administration, at M2, the responses went up to 100% for both. After the third vaccination (sequential or in co-administration) at M5, the CD4+ T-cell response rates were similar across groups A-D (ranged from 92&#x02013;100% and 77&#x02013;100% to F4 and GRIN pools respectively) with no evident difference between groups for the magnitude of F4- and GRIN-specific CD4+ T-cells.

Both local and systemic reactogenicity were common; they differed little amongst regimens, were self-limited, and were comparable to reactogenicity reported with these products individually [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125954.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. There were no vaccine-related serious adverse events and no differences in moderate or worse adverse events among treatment and placebo groups. There was no evidence of vaccine-induced seropositivity as measured by 4th generation HIV Ag/Ab ELISA at trial completion or rapid HIV test kits in common use throughout Africa. At entry into a long-term follow up study, two rapid HIV tests were used (Alere Determine HIV 1/2 and Trinity Uni-Gold). Two vaccine recipients, one in Group A and one in Group C, had reactive results by Determine HIV test but no evidence of HIV infection by RNA PCR.</p><p>Adjuvanted F4/AS01 and Ad35-GRIN regimens induced high ELISPOT response rates, balanced CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses which persisted over time, and high titers of F4 binding antibodies. The vaccine regimens assessed in this trial were designed to induce multifunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to deal with viral escape and inhibit viral activity across clades. The regimens tested in this trial appeared to induce responses that were additive when compared with each individual component tested alone [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>There is a reasonable consensus that both humoral and T-cell responses will be required for an effective HIV vaccine [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The Step and Phambili HIV vaccine efficacy trials were designed to elicit T-cell responses that might impact viral load; HVTN505 and RV144 were designed to elicit both T-cell responses and antibody responses [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. None of these regimens had a significant impact on viral load or CD4+ count once participants became infected, and only RV144, a community based trial conducted in Thailand, showed protection against HIV acquisition with 31.2% efficacy [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. For both RV144 and Step there was some indication of T-cell pressure exerted on some regions of the virus [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This small glimmer of hope supports the notion that vaccine-induced T cells could help control of HIV infection, as has been amply demonstrated in HIV infected individuals and non-human primates infected with SIV [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125954.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The role of CD4+ T-cells in maintaining HIV-specific cellular and humoral responses has long been postulated with more recent data supporting this notion [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>ELISPOT response rates in Group C (Ad35-GRIN + 2 F4/AS01) and Group D (3 co-administrations) were generally higher than those reported at peak immune response time points with other vaccine regimens tested in phase 1/2 trials and efficacy trials [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125954.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125954.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The magnitude of the response was modest but comparable to that seen with other vaccines using similar sample types, assays and analysis. Gag, Pol and Nef were each recognized to high frequencies and the responses persisted for at least a year. The high recognition of Gag, Pol and Nef may be due, in part, to the lack of HIV-Env in F4/AS01 and Ad35-GRIN vaccines. In the HVTN505 and related studies Env responses predominated [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125954.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>Multifunctional T-cell responses are present in HIV controllers, and such responses may be important for immune control of HIV. Balanced CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses were elicited by these vaccines, with profiles differing across regimens. F4/AS01 induced high levels of F4-specific CD4+ T-cells with cross-reactivity against Clade A and Ad35-GRIN induced CD4+ T-cells against Clade A with weak cross-reactivity against Clade B. Ad35-GRIN administered once in each of Groups A-C induced high levels of GRIN-specific CD8+ T-cells; a higher magnitude of CD8+ responses was maintained up to one year after three co-administrations in group D. The immune marker, CD40L is known as a costimulatory ligand required for T cell help and a marker for activated antigen-specific T cells [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Previous findings in healthy HIV-1-seronegative volunteers and HIV-1-seropositive volunteers showed that the CD4+T-cells induced by F4/AS01B vaccine co-expressed CD40L and IL-2 alone or in combination with TNF-&#x003b1; and/or IFN-&#x003b3; [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125954.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In this study, F4/AS01 induced mainly CD4+ T-cells co-expressing CD40L and one or two cytokines: IL2 and IL2/TNF-&#x003b1;, boosting with Ad35-GRIN did not modify the profile. In group C, the majority of CD4+ T-cells induced by one dose of Ad35-GRIN were multifunctional. In the co-administration group (Group D), high levels of multifunctional CD4+ T-cell responses were induced after 2 doses, and after a third dose were similar. Group D received 3-fold higher amount of Ad35-GRIN and 1.5 fold higher amount of F4/AS01 than the other groups which may have influenced persistence and polyfunctionality of CD4+ and CD8+ immune responses in this group. In all groups, the CD4+ T-cell response was maintained for at least one year after the last vaccination.</p><p>In this study, Ad35-GRIN was shown to be a better prime than boost i.e. higher CD8+ T cells frequency and higher polyfunctionality of CD4+ T cells. Adenoviral vectors appear to be good for priming immune responses as observed in HVTN 078 trial where NYVAC and Ad5 were evaluated. NYVAC was shown to be a better boost than prime for T-cell response as also seen in non-human primate studies [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125954.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The response rates as detected by flow cytometry were generally greater than response rates detected by ELISPOT, the main reason for this is because the ELISPOT is based on IFN-&#x003b3; production only whereas ICS detects responses to IFN-&#x003b3;, Il-2 and TNF-&#x003b1;. Responses to F4/AS01 induce CD4+ T cells expressing mainly IL-2 and Ad35 induces polyfunctional CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells that express mainly IFN-&#x003b3;. Thus differences between ELISPOT and ICS are more marked at 1M and 1.5M post F4/AS01B prime particularly for CD4-specific responses. When Ad35-GRIN is used as a prime or in the co-administration group D, the profile is more polyfunctional and therefore the proportion of T-cells (including CD4 and CD8) expressing IFN-&#x003b3; increases and the difference in percent responses as detected by ICS and ELISPOT is less distinct.</p><p>Anti-HIV inhibitory capacity is considered to be an important attribute of CD8+ T-cells and such activities may help control HIV-viral load during acute and chronic infection particularly in long-term non-progressors [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125954.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125954.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In the present trial, viral inhibition activity (VIA) was associated with Ad35-GRIN vaccinations and was not induced by or enhanced by F4/AS01 alone. The VIA magnitude, response rate and breadth was similar to that seen in other HIV vaccine trials using a similar assay [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125954.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125954.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] but of lower magnitude than that seen in long-term non-progressors [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125954.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125954.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. CD107&#x003b1; or granzyme B, two other important markers to characterize the <bold>c</bold>ytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells, were not prioritized in this study due to the limited blood volume.</p><p>Antibodies against F4-protein were detected in 100% of individuals in all groups. The high response rate and titers were driven by the F4/AS01 administration; Ad35-GRIN has previously been shown to induce only modest anti-Gag responses [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125954.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The antibody response rates are similar to previous data with gp120, Nef and Tat administered with AS01 [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>In a collaborative study, we carefully studied the seroprevalence of Ad5, Ad26 and Ad35 in the populations targeted for the current study [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The Ad35 platform was designed as an alternative to Ad5 vectors because of the lower seroprevalence and lower titers for Ad35 seen across the world. Ad35 is a human adenovirus serotype with low world-wide seroprevalence compared to Ad5 [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Across the 4 trial centers, 50/353 (14.2%) volunteers were screened out prior to enrollment in the trial because of pre-existing Ad35 neutralizing titers, all of which were low, as shown previously for East Africa [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Even after three co-administrations of F4/AS01+Ad35GRIN, only 13/27 (48%) of volunteers had Ad35 neutralizing antibodies, and these were of low titer [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Low seroconversion rates and low titers have been noted previously after Ad35 and Chimpanzee Adenovirus administration in humans [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125954.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125954.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The reasons for the differences in seroconversion rates and titers between different Ads are not clear, the Ad35 neutralizing assay may not be sensitive enough to detect very low titers or the assay does not pick up all neutralizing antibody epitopes. Higher vaccine doses of Ad35 or Chimp Ad administered to humans increases the vaccine take and titer in some volunteers. However, some volunteers still did not have a response to the vector but did have a response to the insert which may suggest HLA or other immune response associated with Ad vector responses [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125954.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p><p>Ad35 vectors also have a different serotype, cellular receptor and innate and immune signaling mechanisms compared to Ad5 [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In contrast, Ad5 neutralizing titers are highly prevalent worldwide and particularly in Africa and high levels of Ad5 neutralizing antibody responses are elicited post vaccination [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125954.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125954.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125954.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In spite of pre-existing Ad5 neutralization titers, strong HIV-specific T cell and antibody responses are detected in the majority of volunteers enrolled in Ad5 trials. Likewise, for malaria Ad35 vaccine trials, robust T cell and antibody responses are detected in the majority of participants [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125954.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Results from ongoing HIV vaccine trials also indicate that the presence of pre-existing Ad35 and Ad26 neutralizing antibodies does not impact HIV-specific T cell and antibody responses. Pre-existing Ad5 neutralizing antibodies and other immune responses have been associated with increased susceptibility to HIV-infection after vaccination with Ad5-gag, pol, nef [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125954.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125954.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p><p>It would have been valuable to compare the impressive systemic T cell responses with those of mucosal cells such as &#x003b1;4&#x003b3;7+ expressing CD4+ T cells. However, this study did not obtain biopsy samples hence did not evaluate T cell subsets that are targeted by the HIV virus. Future studies with these vaccines should evaluate target T cell subsets in humans as described recently [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Another limitation of this study is that the total volume of blood was limited so the primary immunogenicity assays were prioritized hence no Adenovirus peptide pool was included in the functional screens.</p><p>Placebo recipients were included to provide an appropriate control group for evaluation of vaccine safety and tolerability, particularly local and systemic reactogenicity [<xref rid="pone.0125954.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. We felt this was particularly important for these prime boost regimens including an adjuvant, as adjuvants may have significant reactogenicity profiles. This trial was designed to evaluate immunogenicity responses in people without Ad35 pre-existing immunity, therefore it is difficult to comment on the issue of potential enhancement due to pre-existing Ad35 immunity. In subsequent trials (unpublished data) we have evaluated the Ad35-GRIN and other Ad35 vaccines in people with and without Ad35 pre-existing immunity.</p><p>Overall the combination of adjuvanted F4 and Ad35 GRIN induced balanced CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses with multifunctional profiles which persisted over time and high titers of F4 binding antibodies. The vaccine regimens assessed in this trial were designed to induce multifunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to deal with viral escape and inhibit viral activity across clades. Next generation immunogens may further improve the quality and breadth of T-cell responses across clades and should be incorporated into regimens such as those assessed in this trial: using low-seroprevalent adenoviral vectors and adjuvanted proteins in co-administration, ideally combined with Env immunogens with the capacity to induce neutralizing and/or non-neutralizing antibodies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec032"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0125954.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT Checklist.</title><p>IAVI B002 study CONSORT checklist of information.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0125954.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0125954.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>ELISPOT responses to HIV peptide pools.</title><p>IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot responses to individual peptide pools 4 weeks after last vaccine (M5).
