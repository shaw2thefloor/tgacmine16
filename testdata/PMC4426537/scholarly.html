            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>Intensive Care Units (ICUs) provide life-supporting treatment; however, resources
               are limited, so demand may exceed supply in the event of pandemics, environmental
               disasters, or in the context of an aging population. We hypothesized that comprehensive
               national data on ICU resources would permit a better understanding of regional differences
               in system capacity.

            <title>Methods</title>
            <p>After the 2009–2010 Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, the Canadian Critical Care Trials
               Group surveyed all acute care hospitals in Canada to assess ICU capacity. Using a
               structured survey tool administered to physicians, respiratory therapists and nurses,
               we determined the number of ICU beds, ventilators, and the ability to provide specialized
               support for respiratory failure.

            <title>Results</title>
            <p>We identified 286 hospitals with 3170 ICU beds and 4982 mechanical ventilators for
               critically ill patients. Twenty-two hospitals had an ICU that routinely cared for
               children; 15 had dedicated pediatric ICUs. Per 100,000 population, there was substantial
               variability in provincial capacity, with a mean of 0.9 hospitals with ICUs (provincial
               range 0.4-2.8), 10 ICU beds capable of providing mechanical ventilation (provincial
               range 6–19), and 15 invasive mechanical ventilators (provincial range 10–24). There
               was only moderate correlation between ventilation capacity and population size (coefficient
               of determination (R
               <sup>2</sup>) = 0.771).

            <p>ICU resources vary widely across Canadian provinces, and during times of increased
               demand, may result in geographic differences in the ability to care for critically
               ill patients. These results highlight the need to evolve inter-jurisdictional resource
               sharing during periods of substantial increase in demand, and provide background data
               for the development of appropriate critical care capacity benchmarks.

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>ICUs provide life-supporting treatments to critically ill patients. ICU resources
            are limited and costly in Canadian hospitals. Clinicians must consider the possible
            benefits of admission to ICU, and hospital administrators must coordinate the provision
            of procedures and surgeries requiring critical care with existing capacity [

            </span>]. During periods of increased demand for ICU resources, such as during infectious
            outbreaks or pandemics, it can be difficult to match available resources to clinical
            demands [

            </span>], resulting in the potential for rationing of ICU care [

               <sup>
                  <a href="#CR6">6</a>

         </p>
         <p>There is substantial global variation in the capacity to provide critical care [

                  <a href="#CR7">7</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Previous estimates using national health administrative data indicate that Canada
            has far fewer ICU beds per capita than the United States, but similar numbers of ICU
            beds to those in many Western European nations [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">

                  <a href="#CR8">8</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Because healthcare is a provincial portfolio in Canada, differences in provincial
            priorities may translate to differences in availability of specific resources. Moreover,
            because critical care services represent one of the most expensive components of the
            healthcare system [

            </span>], cost is an additional reason for regional differences.
         </p>
         <p>Although there have been prior provincial assessments [

            </span>], our overall national critical care capacity is unknown. Therefore, during the period
            after the 2009 to 2010 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, the Canadian Critical Care Trials
            Group undertook a national survey of all acute care hospitals to determine the number
            of critical care beds and mechanical ventilators, as well as the availability of specialized
            support for respiratory failure in critically ill adults and children. We hypothesized
            that comprehensive national data on ICU resources would permit a better understanding
            of regional differences in system capacity in Canada, inform the potential need for
            inter-jurisdictional resource sharing during periods of increased national and provide
            background data for the development of appropriate critical care capacity benchmarks.

            <h3>Questionnaire development</h3>
            <p>We developed a capacity survey to tabulate each hospital’s critical care resources
               using rigorous methodology [

               </span>]. Questionnaire development consisted of item generation and reduction with input
               from critical care physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, clinical researchers,
               and research ethics officers. The questionnaire was subsequently tested for sensibility
               and reliability [

               invasive ventilators, availability of specialized supports for respiratory failure,
               and a field for qualitative comments. Recognizing no uniformly accepted definition,
               we used a sensitive definition of ICU and subsequently determined capacity for ongoing
               invasive mechanical ventilation in an ICU (that is, not the emergency department or
               post-anesthetic care unit) (see Additional file

            <h3>Respondents and survey completion</h3>
            <p>Canadian Critical Care Trials Group members in each province were enlisted as local
               collaborators and site champions in order to identify acute care hospitals and ICUs
               through snowball sampling of colleagues and relevant government-specific and hospital-specific
               contacts. In some provinces, pre-existing lists had been generated by ministries or
               departments of health (British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, New Brunswick) or critical
               care societies (Quebec). The search for acute care institutions was supplemented by
               a manual search of the 
               <i>Guide to Canadian Healthcare Facilities</i> [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">
                  <sup>

               </span>], pre-existing hospital lists of the Public Health Agency of Canada, Google Maps,
               and web searches for all hospitals.
            </p>
            <p>An ICU physician lead for each hospital was identified and contacted by email or telephone.
               Subsequently, nursing and respiratory therapy leaders were contacted by email or telephone
               from pre-existing lists, referral from nearby institutions, or through telephone solicitation
               directly to the hospital or ICU. The survey was then transmitted by email or fax for
               self-administration, or administered via telephone to physicians, nurses, and/or respiratory
               therapists. In hospitals with more than one ICU, additional ICU-specific contacts
               were established by subsequent telephone or email communication. In rare cases where
               no ICU-specific contact could be identified, or the leader did not respond (generally
               for small hospitals that had no geographically distinct ICU), we obtained information
               from an informed clinician who was primarily affiliated with another nearby hospital.
            </p>
            <p>Respondents were to provide capacity data at the time of the survey. We attempted
               to complete data collection for each site within a 3-month time frame to limit temporal
               changes in any measure. In some cases, there was uncertainty about the number of available
               ICU beds because of staffing shortages. We asked respondents to answer based upon
               how many ICU beds were usually available for admission should staffing not be a limitation.
               We attempted to resolve uncertainty about the number of ICUs and bed numbers capable
               of ventilation through communication with more than one local physician and nurse
               leader. Respiratory therapy leaders resolved uncertainty about numbers of ventilators,
               and availability of inhaled nitric oxide, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation,
               and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

            <p>Descriptive statistics are presented as counts, proportions, medians (with range or
               interquartile range), and means (± standard deviation) as appropriate using Microsoft
               Excel (Redmond, WA, USA) or SAS (Carey, NC, USA). We tested the relationship between
               the number of ICU beds capable of ventilation and the population by health and census
               regions using the 
               <i>R</i>

            <h3>Overall resources</h3>
            <p>We identified 362 acute care centers in 10 provinces and three territories. There
               were 286 hospitals with at least one self-designated ICU that was capable of providing
               invasive mechanical ventilation. ICUs in 22 hospitals had designated beds for pediatric
               patients, and 15 hospitals had stand-alone pediatric ICUs. The vast majority of ICUs
               (280, 97.9%) were capable of caring for mixed, medical and surgical, patient populations.
               Many ICUs (27, 9.4%) cared for medical, cardiac, or cardiothoracic surgery patients
               either in isolation or in addition to other critically ill patients. Two ICUs cared
               exclusively for critically burned patients, whereas four routinely cared for some
               burned patients, and three ICUs cared exclusively for neurologically injured or neurosurgical
               patients.
            </p>
            <p>In hospitals with an ICU capable of providing invasive mechanical ventilation there
               was a total of 4,309 beds, of which 3,170 were specifically designated for mechanical
               ventilation. Among hospitals with an ICU capable of providing invasive mechanical
               ventilation there was a median of nine (interquartile range (IQR) 5 to 18) ICU beds
               with eight (IQR 3 to 14) beds available for patients who required invasive mechanical
               ventilation. There was a total of 4,982 ventilators capable of providing invasive
               mechanical ventilation, including ventilators used for patient transportation (but
               not those primarily used to deliver inhalational anesthesia during surgery) and a
               median of 10 (IQR 5 to 23) invasive ventilators per hospital (Table 
               <span ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">
                  <a href="#Tab1">1</a>
               </span>). In terms of specialized support for respiratory failure, there were 178 high-frequency
               oscillatory ventilators in 72 (25.2%) hospitals that had an ICU capable of delivering
               ventilation, inhaled nitric oxide in 79 (27.6%) hospitals, and extracorporeal membrane
               oxygenation in 39 (13.6%) hospitals. All three supports were available in 32 (11.1%)
               hospitals – all being university teaching centers.

            <h3>Resources according to the type of hospital</h3>
            <p>There was considerable concentration of ICU resources for mechanical ventilation in
               teaching hospitals as compared with community hospitals. The total number of teaching
               and community ICU beds capable of mechanical ventilation was 2,027 and 1,143, respectively,
               with a median number of 20 (IQR 11 to 31) beds and five (IQR 2 to 8) beds, respectively
               (
               <i>P</i> &lt;0.001). There was moderate correlation between the number of ICU beds capable of
               mechanical ventilation and the population size for both health region divisions (
               <i>R</i>
               <sup>2</sup> = 0.771) and census divisions (

            <h3>Other qualitative characteristics of ICUs</h3>
            <p>Complementary qualitative data acquired in our survey shed important insights into
               critical care capacity in Canada. Some hospitals with small ICUs (that is, fewer than
               six ICU beds) commented that despite their capacity for ongoing ventilation, it was
               common practice to attempt to transfer patients to larger ICUs after a variable period
               of time (many days to a week). Many hospitals commented that lack of personnel (especially
               nurses) prevented the full utilization of ICU beds and ventilator capacity. In hospitals
               with more than one ICU, conflicts in admission decision processes prevented optimal
               ICU bed utilization. For instance, open beds were maintained in subspecialty ICUs
               while general ICUs were at or above capacity.

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>We found substantial variation in the numbers of ICU beds, as well as the capacity
            for mechanical ventilation and specialized support for respiratory failure among ICUs
            in Canada. These findings were not fully explained by the size of the population.
            This variation in capacity may result in differential decision-making about who can
            receive ICU support, and which services can be supported in specific hospitals and
            regions during times of increased demand [

         <p>Prior work by our group using health administrative data from the Canadian Institute
            for Health Information estimated that there were 319 ICUs, 3,388 total adult ICU beds
            (representing 3.4% of all acute care hospital beds), and 13.5 ICU beds per 100,000
            population [

            did not include data from Quebec, did not include any interprovincial comparisons,
            did not estimate the capacity to treat critically ill patients requiring mechanical
            ventilation, and were generated one decade ago. Our assessment of ICU beds per 100,000
            population places Canada near the median of high-income and Organization for Economic
            Co-operation and Development countries, notably above the United Kingdom but well

         <p>Without knowledge of Canadian critical care capacity, and in the absence of provincial,
            national, or international targets for population-based critical care resources, there
            has been limited national attention to ensuring optimal distribution among regions.
            The results of this survey highlight expected north–south geography-based capacity
            trends, but also an unanticipated apparent east–west gradient with relative increased
            capacity among the Atlantic Provinces, in comparison with central and western Canada.
            Some members of our group have previously reported wide variation in ICU capacity
            within British Columbia and an inverse relationship between ICU beds, population density,
            and population growth, highlighting the potential for mismatch in demand and capacity
            in Canada [

         </p>
         <p>Some variation in distribution of healthcare services is probably a consequence of
            differential regional models of healthcare delivery. For example, there are substantial
            differences in population density across Canada, with marked north-to-south increases
            in density – approximately 80% of Canadians live within 160 km of the Canada–United
            States border [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#CR23">23</a>
               </sup>
            </span>] – and there is marked intra-provincial urban–rural variability [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#CR24">24</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Many systems of intra-provincial regionalization of care that are responsive to
            population density, geographic barriers, or evolved regional care systems also may
            lead to differences in the distribution of critical care services. Moreover, despite
            provincial administration of most healthcare services, there is also some well-established
            inter-provincial ICU care, with regionalized trauma services, specialized care delivery
            for northern territories among bordering provinces, and populations of one province
            that are closest to a specialized healthcare center in a neighboring province. It
            is not clear, however, whether specialized services’ referral relationships work well
            during times of healthcare crisis such a pandemic when regions may react to future
            uncertainty by trying to conserve resources for more local use.
         </p>
         <p>This study has important limitations. First, this survey was carried out using existing
            national and provincial databases of hospitals, and it is possible that some acute
            care hospitals may have been missed. However, we subsequently employed snowball sampling
            and web and map searching techniques to identify all hospitals and ICUs in each province,
            and then sought out a combination of physician, nurse, respiratory therapist, and
            hospital administrator leaders to derive current ICU beds and ventilator capacity
            at each hospital. After compiling local data, each participant and provincial health
            authority was given the opportunity to critique the aggregate estimates to improve
            accuracy. Second, population denominator-based comparisons may not be the optimal
            mechanism for normalization in all regions with varying population density, age demographic
            differences, geographic barriers, and distinct systems of regionalized care for some
            tertiary and quaternary services such as trauma and transplantation. However, our
            results indicate relatively wide variability in ICU capacity among provinces and therefore
            may provide helpful inter-provincial comparisons. Third, this study focused on a very
            narrow spectrum of services needed to provide critical care – ICUs, beds, ventilators,
            and specialized supports for respiratory failure. It was beyond the scope of this
            survey to evaluate personnel (dieticians, nurses, pharmacists, physicians, physiotherapists,
            respiratory therapists, social workers) or other resources that are essential to the
            care of critically ill patients. Indeed, lack of available critical care clinical
            staff is among the most common reason for limitations in bed availability [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>]. Future resource planning must address this key knowledge gap. Fourth, ICU resources
            are not static, and this survey represents a period prevalence of approximately 3 months
            at the hospital level and approximately 1 year among all sites, in a period after
            the H1N1 pandemic where knowledge of ICU capacity may have been greatest.
         </p>
         <p>Our results highlight the need to examine capacity both in relation to local needs
            and in comparison with other regions. It is important to note that the organization
            of critical care within Canada has not been static since conducting this survey. Alberta
            has reorganized critical care services under one structure, with a standardized provincial
            bedside clinical information system/electronic medical record [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>]. Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome experience, the Ministry of Health
            and Long-term Care in Ontario has maintained a Critical Care Strategy to oversee a
            similar cataloguing of critical care services including twice-daily clinical updates
            of every patient in ICUs into a centralized electronic database that facilitates critical
            care inter-facility transportation services, reporting on quality metrics and decision-making
            on surge capacity [

               </sup>
            </span>]. British Columbia and Nova Scotia have recently formed Critical Care Working Groups
            within the Ministry of Health to coordinate data collection and reporting, improvement
            of care processes, transportation of critically ill patients, and improvement of staffing
            models in ICUs. In 2011 Quebec created a Groupe d’Experts en Soins Intensifs working
            with the Ministry of Health to improve quality and accessibility of ICUs and a mandate
            to establish provincial ICU capacity.

         <p>One of the lessons learned from the severe acute respiratory syndrome and influenza

            Of relevance to surge planning, we were able to quantify the excess numbers of invasive
            mechanical ventilators relative to ICU beds, highlighting capacity that may exist
            beyond existing ICU beds. The ability to provide advanced oxygenation with one of
            three modes of support was available in a minority of hospitals. Furthermore, this
            expertise was unevenly distributed across provinces, and was focused at university-affiliated
            teaching hospitals. However, we were unable to gauge experience with specialized ventilation
            alongside capacity. We did not determine capacity for other techniques such as prone
            ventilation, which may be less dependent upon specific technology, more dependent
            upon generation of a local experience base, and have a greater evidence base for efficacy
            than either early high-frequency ventilation or use of inhaled nitric oxide [

            that we evolve a system in which excess capacity in one region may aid another, either
            through safe transportation of patients or short-term movement of equipment or personnel
            to existing or temporary facilities [

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>ICU resources vary widely across Canadian provinces, and during times of increased
            demand may result in geographic differences in the ability to care for critically
            ill patients. These results may guide future decision-making, but must also be complemented
            by estimates of current and future healthcare personnel supply and projections of
            demand for critical care from an aging population [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#CR34">34</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Greater ongoing knowledge of regional critical care resources may help us respond
            to increases in demand from unpredictable events such as infectious outbreaks or regional
            medical emergencies. While some regional imbalances may persist, there should be deliberate
            planning for mechanisms to deal with both unexpected and day-to-day surge in demand.
            Mechanisms are needed to rapidly share and deploy resources – both equipment and personnel
            – across provincial boundaries to deliver a more equitable, coordinated, and responsive
            system of healthcare for critically ill Canadians.

                  <p>During times of increased demand, variability in ICU resources may result in geographic
