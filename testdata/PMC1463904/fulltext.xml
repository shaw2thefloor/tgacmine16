In R&#x000e9;union Island, this alphavirus has already infected about one-third of the human population. The main clinical symptom of the disease is a painful and invalidating poly-arthralgia. Besides the arthralgic form, 123 patients with a confirmed chikungunya infection have developed severe clinical signs, i.e., neurological signs or fulminant hepatitis.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>We report the nearly complete genome sequence of six selected viral isolates (isolated from five sera and one cerebrospinal fluid), along with partial sequences of glycoprotein E1 from a total of 127 patients from R&#x000e9;union, Seychelles, Mauritius, Madagascar, and Mayotte islands. Our results indicate that the outbreak was initiated by a strain related to East-African isolates, from which viral variants have evolved following a traceable microevolution history. Unique molecular features of the outbreak isolates were identified. Notably, in the region coding for the non-structural proteins, ten amino acid changes were found, four of which were located in alphavirus-conserved positions of nsP2 (which contains helicase, protease, and RNA triphosphatase activities) and of the polymerase nsP4. The sole isolate obtained from the cerebrospinal fluid showed unique changes in nsP1 (T301I), nsP2 (Y642N), and nsP3 (E460 deletion), not obtained from isolates from sera. In the structural proteins region, two noteworthy changes (A226V and D284E) were observed in the membrane fusion glycoprotein E1. Homology 3D modelling allowed mapping of these two changes to regions that are important for membrane fusion and virion assembly. Change E1-A226V was absent in the initial strains but was observed in &#x0003e;90&#x00025; of subsequent viral sequences from R&#x000e9;union, denoting evolutionary success possibly due to adaptation to the mosquito vector.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The unique molecular features of the analyzed Indian Ocean isolates of chikungunya virus demonstrate their high evolutionary potential and suggest possible clues for understanding the atypical magnitude and virulence of this outbreak.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Viral genome sequence isolated from 6 patients and partial sequences of isolates from 121 patients at different stages and locations of the outbreak reveals unique and evolving genetic features.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted alphavirus belonging to family Togaviridae &#x0005b;

				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030263-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Poly-arthralgia, the typical clinical sign of the disease, is very painful. Symptoms are generally self-limiting and last 1&#x02013;10 d. However, arthralgia may persist for months or years. In some patients, minor hemorrhagic signs such as epistaxis or gingivorrhagia have also been described.
			</p><p>CHIKV is geographically distributed in Africa, India, and South-East Asia. In Africa, the virus is maintained through a sylvatic transmission cycle between wild primates and mosquitoes such as

				<named-content content-type="genus-species">A. taylori</named-content> &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030263-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. In Asia, CHIKV is transmitted from human to human mainly by 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species">A. aegypti</named-content> and, to a lesser extent, by 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species">A. albopictus</named-content> through an urban transmission cycle. Since the 1952 Tanzania outbreak, CHIKV has caused outbreaks in East Africa (Tanzania and Uganda), in Austral Africa (Zimbabwe and South Africa), in West Africa (Senegal and Nigeria), and in Central Africa (Central African Republic and Democratic Republic of the Congo) &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030263-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. The most recent epidemic re-emergence was documented in 1999&#x02013;2000 in Kinshasa, where an estimated 50,000 persons were infected &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030263-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. Since the first documented Asian outbreak in 1958 in Bangkok, Thailand, outbreaks have been documented in Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, Malaysia, Philippines, and Indonesia &#x0005b;

				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030263-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. In both Africa and Asia, the re-emergence was unpredictable, with intervals of 7&#x02013;8 y to 20 y between consecutive epidemics.
			</p><p>Since the end of 2004, CHIKV has emerged in the islands of the south-western Indian Ocean. Between January and March 2005, more than 5,000 cases were reported in Comoros. Later in 2005, the virus has circulated in the other islands, i.e, Mayotte, Seychelles, R&#x000e9;union, and Mauritius. Starting in December 2005, the rainy season gave rise to a renewed epidemic circulation of the virus. Since January 1, 2006, several thousands cases were reported in each of Mayotte, Mauritius, and Seychelles islands (
				<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.invs.sante.fr">http://www.invs.sante.fr</ext-link>, 21 April, 2006). The most affected island is R&#x000e9;union (total population: 770,000), with an estimated 244,000 cases (16 April, 2006). More recently, circulation of the virus has also been documented in Madagascar and in India.
			</p><p>In R&#x000e9;union Island, the first documented cases were patients coming back from Comoros in March 2005. More than 3,000 cases were reported from March to June &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030263-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Transmission was limited (50&#x02013;100 cases per week) during the winter season of the southern hemisphere, and a major upsurge was observed from mid-December &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030263-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;, with an estimated 12,400 cases in 2005 and an estimated 231,600 cases in 2006 (16 April, 2006). The peak incidence in 2006 was observed during the second week of February, with more than 45,000 cases. The number of cases has now decreased, with an estimated 3,000 cases during the second week of April. Since March 2005, 123 patients with a confirmed CHIKV infection have developed severe clinical signs (neurological signs or fulminant hepatitis) that justified hospitalization in an intensive care unit. Several cases of encephalopathy and major algic syndrome have been associated with vertical transmission of the virus (
				<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.invs.sante.fr">http://www.invs.sante.fr</ext-link>).
			</p><p>CHIKV is an enveloped, positive-strand RNA virus. To date, two CHIKV complete nucleotide sequences have been determined, for the strains Ross and S27 &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030263-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;, both isolated from patients during the 1952 Tanzania outbreak. Another complete nucleotide sequence has been determined for a strain isolated in 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species">A. furcifer</named-content> during the Senegal 1983 outbreak (accession no AY726732). Khan et al &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030263-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d; showed that the S27 genome was similar in its structure to that of other alphaviruses and that O'nyong-nyong virus (ONN) was the closest relative to CHIKV. In addition, phylogenetic analyses based on partial E1 sequences from African and Asian isolates revealed the existence of three distinct CHIKV phylogroups: one containing all isolates from West Africa, one containing isolates from Asia, and one corresponding to Eastern, Central, and Southern African isolates &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030263-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Strains isolated in 1999&#x02013;2000 in the Democratic Republic of Congo belonged to the latter phylogroup &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030263-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;.
			</p><p>In the present study, we determined the nearly complete nucleotide sequences of viruses isolated from six patients originating from R&#x000e9;union and Seychelles islands. In addition, partial E1 sequences were determined from sera or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from a total of 127 patients from R&#x000e9;union, Seychelles, Madagascar, Mayotte, and Mauritius. Our objectives were to determine the genome structure as well as the unique molecular features of the Indian Ocean outbreak isolates, which may distinguish them from other reported CHIKV and alphavirus sequences. In addition, the phylogenetic origin and the diversity and microevolution of the CHIKV strains responsible for the Indian Ocean outbreak were investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>The 127 patients for whom partial or complete CHIKV nucleotide sequences were determined originated from R&#x000e9;union (

Isolate 05.61 was initially selected for genome analysis because it was isolated in March 2005, at the onset of the outbreak, from a R&#x000e9;union patient returning from Comoros Island, where the outbreak had been going on since January 2005. Remarkably, the isolates 05.61 and 05.115 (which was the second earliest isolate analyzed), the African isolate S27, and previous unrelated chikungunya isolates from Africa and Asia were identical at all 14 polymorphic sites. Therefore, the consensus sequence of isolates 05.61 and 05.115 (consensus sequence 1) likely represents the ancestral genotype of the R&#x000e9;union outbreak. Distribution of the 14 polymorphisms suggested that this founder gave rise to three consensus sequences that likely evolved in four steps. First, substitution at genome position 10,670 (causing the E1 A226V change) gave rise to consensus sequence 2, represented by the late-November 2005 isolate 06.21. Second, a G-to-A synonymous substitution at position 6,547 (nsP4) led to an intermediate sequence, which itself gave rise to two late sequences: consensus sequence 3 (isolate 06.27), following four additional substitutions and one codon deletion (

The magnitude of the epidemics has surprised the population, policy makers, and public health specialists, although chikungunya is not uncommon in nearby regions of this part of the world. Our phylogenetic analyses based on partial glycoprotein E1 sequences indicate that the Indian Ocean outbreak was caused by the same strain on R&#x000e9;union, Seychelles, Mayotte, Madagascar, and Mauritius islands, and show that the outbreak strain is related to East-, Central-, and South-African isolates. Although, to our knowledge, no outbreak was reported recently in East Africa, this scenario is compatible with the human population exchanges between East Africa and Comoros, where the outbreak is believed to have started. Whether the epidemic strain results from the evolution of an enzootic strain, as previously described for eastern equine encephalitis virus &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030263-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;, cannot be excluded. Sequencing of additional isolates from recent outbreaks in Africa and from possible local reservoirs should define more precisely the origin of the Indian Ocean outbreak.
			</p><p>This study represents the first survey, to our knowledge, of intra-outbreak analysis of CHIKV nucleotide variation on a genomic scale. The availability of multiple nearly complete genome sequences allowed us to deduce the probable history of successive molecular evolutionary changes that may have occurred while the outbreak was still ongoing. This evolutionary scenario is the most likely based on the six consensus sequences obtained, although additional isolates and determination of quasispecies heterogeneity are needed to obtain a more precise picture of viral evolution during the outbreak.</p><p>Whereas E1-226A was the only genotype observed during the first period of the R&#x000e9;union outbreak (March&#x02013;June 2005), our data show the emergence and predominance of genotype E1-226V, which was observed from the beginning of September 2005 and experienced a spectacular rise in frequency. The appearance of E1-226V preceded by at least 3 mo the explosive epidemic peak of mid-December 2005, and the link between this aa change and the rate of transmission thus deserves further investigation. Interestingly, a mutation at residue 226 in SFV was observed to release the cholesterol dependence of the virus &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030263-b027">27</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030263-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. It is thus possible that such a mutation provides a selective advantage to the virus in mosquitoes, which are cholesterol auxotrophs. Indeed, in the SFV E1 crystal structure, position 226 is located in the ij loop, in contact with the fusion peptide, in a region of the protein that is predicted to interact with the target membrane. On the other hand, this change may be selectively neutral, and other evolutionary factors such as genetic drift or a founder effect could have favoured E1-226V by chance alone. In Sindbis virus, a change at position 226 alone was not sufficient to release cholesterol dependence &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030263-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. Our data thus point to interesting experiments comparing the cholesterol dependence of the isolates differing at position 226 in E1.
			</p><p>To date, only CHIKV laboratory strains, passaged many times on mosquito or mammalian cells, had been entirely sequenced &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030263-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. We provide for the first time nearly complete nucleotide sequences of six clinical isolates passaged in vitro only once or twice (see 
				<xref ref-type="sec" rid="st2">Methods</xref>). Limiting the number of passages is crucial because the infecting viral population may correspond to a quasispecies &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030263-b032">32</xref>&#x02013;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030263-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;, i.e., a mixed viral population with genotypes co-existing in an equilibrium governed by a balance between mutation and natural selection. Repeated in vitro passages may act as a filter on this population. For example, the presence in S27 of an Arg codon instead of the opal stop codon in Indian Ocean isolates is probably explained by numerous in vitro passages of S27, as evolution of opal to Arg was observed experimentally in ONN viruses &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030263-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. Whereas it may be advantageous for viral quasispecies to maintain the opal codon in vivo, an Arg codon may confer a selective advantage in vitro, as observed for the closely related SFV &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030263-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. In the present study, careful inspection of the chromatograms traces identified three codons with double peaks observed both on forward and reverse traces (
				<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figure S3</xref>). In all three cases, alternative bases corresponded to non-synonymous codons that may thus alter viral fitness. It is tempting to speculate that quasispecies diversity in vivo might facilitate the access to different body sites, such as the central nervous system. For example, selection for a subset of genotypes harbouring the changes observed in CSF isolate 06.27 may be associated with invasion of the CSF &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030263-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. These observations underscore that the genome sequence of laboratory &#x0201c;reference&#x0201d; strains may not accurately reflect the natural situation, as the genotypic complexity of quasispecies in vivo is subject to erosion by in vitro selection. Since the Indian Ocean isolates sequenced here were subjected to in vitro selection for only a few generations, they probably correspond more closely to the in vivo genotypes than previously sequenced chikungunya strains.
			</p><p>The aa differences detected among the outbreak isolates may relate to biological or pathogenic characteristics of the virus. Although our viral culture results are preliminary, they clearly show phenotypic differences between the unique isolate from CSF (06.27), isolated from a neonatal encephalopathy case, and three other isolates from sera associated with either the classical form of the disease or encephalopathy. The larger foci observed in culture with 06.27 could reflect a higher replication rate of the virus and be linked to the specific aa changes identified in nsP1, nsP2, and nsP3. Single aa changes in nsP1, including a Thr/Ile change (residue 538 of Sindbis virus) &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030263-b036">36</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030263-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d; and a 18-nt deletion in nsP3 have previously been shown to affect neurovirulence in other alphaviruses &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030263-b036">36</xref>&#x02013;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030263-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. However, in the absence of nsP1, nsP2, and nsP3 structural data, it is difficult to predict whether the specific aa changes observed in isolate 06.27 can have a structural or functional impact. We also noted that all the viral sequences determined from either the serum or the isolates from three neonatal encephalopathy cases and an adult meningo-encephalitis case had E1-226V. However, as this genotype is also observed in classical forms of the disease, one cannot conclude on a potential link of E1-226V with neuropathogenesis. Host factors also have to be considered in the occurrence of neurological forms of the disease. For example, the blood&#x02013;brain crossing may be favoured by age or hypertension.
			</p><p>Molecular signatures of the Indian Ocean outbreak genomes were identified when they were compared to all other reported alphavirus sequences. However, these comparisons have to be considered with caution because of a potential sampling bias due to the small number of previous alphavirus sequences. Nevertheless, these features represent interesting targets for future functional studies, as well as for epidemiological follow-up. One particularly interesting feature was the E1-226V residue (see above). Another interesting molecular signature was E1&#x02013;284 Asp. Although the pseudo-atomic model of the scaffold used is of modest resolution (the resolution of the crystal structure is limited&#x02014;approaching 3&#x000c5;&#x02014;and the model results of fitting this structure into a 9&#x000c5; resolution cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction), it appears that the side-chain of Asp 284 interacts with the main chain of an adjacent E1 polypeptide in the virion. Indeed, it is in a position compatible with acceptance of a hydrogen bond from a main chain amide in the contacting E1 protomer. Because the packing is very tight (see 
				<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030263-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), it is possible that the longer glutamic acid side chain (which has an extra CH
				<sub>2</sub> group compared to Asp or Asn) may introduce a slight distortion at the contact sites, an effect that is propagated by the icosahedral T &#x0003d; 4 symmetry of the virion. Thus, a cooperative effect due to this change at position Asp 284 may play a role in either allowing a less efficient assembly of new particles in infected cells, or a more efficient particle disassembly process during invasion of a new cell, or a combination of both. This information can guide new site-directed mutagenesis studies, using reverse genetics, to test the effect of the Asp/Glu replacement on the virus cycle.
			</p><p>The magnitude and high political profile of the outbreak has underlined the critical lack of knowledge on the biology of CHIKV, contrasting with related model alphaviruses such as Sindbis, Semliki Forest, and Ross River. This situation reflects the fact that chikungunya infection, despite infecting millions of people since its discovery, has been neglected. However, chikungunya disease is clearly responsible for disabling and persistent arthralgia, although it remains unresolved whether the symptoms are due to persistence of the virus or inappropriate immune response &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030263-b039">39</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030263-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, during the Indian Ocean CHIKV outbreak, a small proportion of the patients (about 123 out of 244,000 infected) developed severe clinical signs such as neurological signs or hepatitis. Whereas neurovirulence and neuroinvasiveness are established for several alphaviruses such as eastern equine encephalitis virus and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, only two CHIKV strains had previously been isolated from children with clinical signs suggestive of encephalitis and meningitis &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030263-b041">41</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030263-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. Whether CHIKV Indian Ocean strains have acquired a higher neurovirulence or neuroinvasiveness certainly deserves investigation.
			</p><p>In the absence of efficient vaccine or antiviral therapy, vector control is at present the only way to limit chikungunya transmission. However, the broad geographic distribution of the mosquito vectors 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species">A. albopictus</named-content> and 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species">A. aegyptii</named-content> &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030263-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d; may allow the expansion of CHIKV to new areas, such as the European or American continents. The molecular data reported here on clinical isolates from the current epidemics should contribute to bridge the gap of knowledge concerning this human pathogen, and will help to provide, in the middle term, more specific and powerful tools to combat it.
